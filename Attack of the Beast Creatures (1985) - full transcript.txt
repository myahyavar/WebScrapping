- Help!Help!- There's a woman out there!- We're drifting.We're drifting away fromthe other life boats!- Well?- Well, somebody do something!You! You're part of the crew!- Hey, sit down!- Well, look where we're going.- Do you think we're caught in a current?


- We must be.There's no reason to get alarmed though.- But I get this feelingwe're drifting faster than the current.- Mr. Morgan.Mr. Morgan.Mr. Morgan, wake up.It's your turn to...It's your turn to stand watch.Here.I didn't see any ships, maybeyou'll have better luck.- Quinn!- Where do you think we are, John?- Your guess is as good as mine.


Greenland, maybe.No...Let's not worry about that now.We need water.- Mr. Bruin!Mr. Bruin!Oh my God!He's dead! He's dead!- He's still alive, give me the canteen.- Hey, wait a minute!That's the last of our water!We need it!- Mrs. Gordon, would youplease take Cathy up thereaway from the boat?- Surely.Come on, dear.Come with us, Diane.- We'll have to carry him to a spotto make him comfortable,then we'll go find more water.- I'll be up with thegirls when you're ready.- You! Aren't you going to help us?- You're wasting your time.The man's as good as dead.We've got to look out for ourselves.- That guy's got a lot of nerve.I'd like to-- Forget him!Let's get this man comfortable!- Cheer up.- I'm sorry, it's just all that blood.- I know.But, you know, he's going to be all right.They're looking after him,and he's going to be all right.- Yeah, he's gonna be fine.- Think about something pleasant.- Think about-- Yeah.- Home.We'll all be home soon.Is he all right?- Ah, they're gonna bring upto the shade or something,but he doesn't have a chance.- You should be all right here.We have to go find some water and food,but we'll be back as soon as possible.- Here's a blanket.He's in bad shape.I don't know if he's going to make it.- Well...We did everything we could.- Is he gonna be all right?- Well, we made him ascomfortable as we could.He'll be okay.- Hey, forget about that guy.There's nothing you can do for him.What about us?- Morgan, I've had about enough of you!- Don't waste your time,Phil, he's not even worth it.- It would be wise to listen to him.- Listen.We're all in this together.Save your feuds until after we're rescued.Right now we have moreimportant things to worry about.For one thing, we don't know how longwe're gonna be on this island.- Well, what should we do?- The only thing we can do.Go inland and see what we can find.- Well...Let's get on with it then!We can't stand around herelooking at each other.- All right.- Let's go.- You know, Morgan, we never got a chanceto know each other aboard the ship.Were you on board for pleasure?- Medical reasons.- Medical reasons?- My wife.Can't walk.Spoke to a surgeon in London.Here I am.- Sorry to hear that, Mr. Morgan.- Yeah.- Hope things work out for ya.- Thanks.- Cathy!Don't drift so far!- Oh, not bad.- How are they?- They should do nicely, Mrs. Gordon.Are you okay, Mrs. Gordon?- I've just been thinking.My husband would've beenmeeting me at the dockjust about now.- Don't worry.You'll be seeing him soon.- In the 20 years that we've been married,we've never been separatedthis long before.- Before you know it, you'llbe arriving at that dock,and he'll be there to greet you.Come on, why don't we tell the othersabout the berries we found?- We'll never find anything here.This is my holiday?All I wanted was to seea little of the world,but I never expected anything like this.Water!- Keep the women away!- Come on, Diane.Come on!- What happened?- Don't go down there.I'll be right back.- What happened?- I don't know.He went for the water.- Well, we've gotta be a lot more carefulwith what we eat and drink now.This stuff could be all over the island.- We've got some edibleberries back there.We could pick enough tohold it through the night.That is, after we bury Pat.- Look.Why don't you take the womenand start gathering some of those berries?We could handle it here.- He gets the easy-- Hey, if you wanna pick the berries,why don't you pick them, Morgan?- Forget it, just forget it!The guy's dead.- What kind of island is this?- I don't know, but we better be carefulof whatever water we find from now on.- Pat's gone.- Oh, geez.- Let's see what we can doabout getting some food for tonight.- How can you think about foodafter what's happened to Pat?- Hey, we have to survive.Diane, listen to me.We have to start thinking about ourselves.We have to find differentways to exist out hereuntil help comes.And the only way to survive is with food.- He's right, you know.Let's see, how about...Roast duck?Smoked salmon?- Mrs. Gordon, you'regetting me really hungry.- I can taste it now, can't you?- Come on, let's go.- Hey, where'd Morgan go with that rock?- Knowing him, he probablywent back to England.Something the matter, John?- I don't know.There's something about this place.Something here.Do you feel it?- I had that feeling ever sincewe moved in from the beach,like somebody's watching us.But who?- If you ask me, I think you'veboth gone off your rocker.- Damn it, Morgan!Don't you ever stop?- Look-- No, wait, maybe he's right.Maybe we're letting this island get to us.Come on, let's finish up.- All right.- You're right.- Let's see what we've got here.- Mm, they're good.But only pick the dark ones.The others aren't quite ripe yet.- Here.Let's use my shawl, and wecan gather the berries there.- That's a good idea.Do you think anyone will everfind us in this awful place?- Eh, I'm sure somebodywill come along, Cathy.We couldn't have drifted too farfrom the main shipping lanes.Besides, there's plenty of food hereto keep us going for a long time.What happened?- I was just reaching for a berry,and something bit me.- Well, let me see that.That's a nasty one.Let me put a handkerchief around that.Well, this should hold ituntil we can fix it properlyand wash it out.Does it hurt much?- No.It's just a scratch.I'll be all right.- Well, now at least we knowthere are animals on the island.Maybe we will have some meat to cook.- What happened to your hand?- Oh, it's nothing.I was just bitten bysomething in the bushes there.- It should hold until wecan clean it out later.- Good.You're a strong woman, Mrs. Gordon.Let's get the others over thereso they could set up for the night.And you and I will go down to the boatand check on Mr. Bruin.- Yeah, you know, while we're down there,we might as well pick up whatever suppliesare leftover in the survival kit.- I think we've got enough berries hereto feed us all for tonight.- I know we don't have much,but try and make yourselvesas comfortable as you can.Mr. Quinn and I are going down to the boatto see what we can salvage.- How do we know you justwon't take off with the boatsand leave us on this godforsaken island?- Morgan, the one thingthat bothers me is,that of all the poor soulson that ship worth saving,we had to pull you from the water!- Trieste.There's enough dead wood in this vicinityto get a fire going.- Good.There's some matches in thesurvival kit on the boat.You ready, Case?- Yeah, let's go.John, it's gonna begetting dark pretty soon.- Let's make this quick.- I'll go check on Mr.Bruin and see how he is.- I'll get the things fromthe boat, I'll meet you there.- Okay.John!- What is it?- Come and look at him, man.Look at him.- Oh my God.What could've done this?- I don't know, rats?- But that fast?Whatever it was, we've gotto keep it to ourselves.The others have enough to worry about.- Yeah, I agree with you there.- I'll cover him up.You get the things from the boat.- Okay. All right.- Tell me something, John.What did you find out there today?- What do you mean?- You and Mr. Quinn...Both been on edge ever since you got back.- It's Mr. Bruin.- The guy was in bad shape,nobody expected him to survive.- It was the way we found him.- Well, how did you find him?- You don't give up, do you, Phil?Well, listen.We didn't want to worryeveryone unnecessarily.Now keep this to yourself.When we got to him, his bodywas picked clean to the bone.- In such a short period of time?From what?- I don't know.Something.Something out there.- I looked at Mrs. Gordon's hand today.- How is it?- She's okay, but...- But what?That's no ordinary animal bite.I've been a vet for years,and I've never seen an animalthat would leave a bite mark like that.- I'm frightened.This place makes my skin crawl.- Come on, dear.Let's try to look on thebright side, shall we?This could be a lot worse, you know.- How?- We could still be adrift on the ocean.- Now there's nothingto worry about, Cathy.We'll be okay.You know, we've got plenty of foodand a dry place to sleep tonight.And besides, first thing in the morning,we're all gonna be going out thereand building signal fires,and we should be rescued in no time.- I know, but I still don't like it here.- You're dreaming!We could be here forever!And as for the food, how arewe gonna survive on these?- Don't you lay off, Morgan?- Why?Because I don't thinkwe're ever gonna get offof this miserable island.- I don't care what you think.And I suggest you keepyour opinions to yourself.- I wonder what his problem is.- I don't know, but Idon't like his attitude.The women are worried enoughwithout him adding to it.- How's the hand, Mrs. Gordon?- Oh, it's just fine.Hardly hurts at all anymore.- Good. I'm glad to hear that.We're gonna be taking turnsstanding watch tonight.- Oh. Is something wrong?- No, no.It's just a good idea whenyou're in an unfamiliar place.Are you okay, Cathy?You feel up to taking a turn tonight?- Oh, yes.It's only fair.- Good.I'll let you know when wefigure out who relieves who.And stay close to the fire tonight.- Hey, you look cold.- Oh, thank you.- How you holdin' up?- Well, we're stuck here.I guess we'll just haveto make the best of it.- You do that very well.- Yeah.I spent most of mychildhood on a farm in lowa.My dad used to sit out on the front porchalmost every eveningafter dinner and whittle.I used to watch him for hours.I guess his love for it rubbed off on me.- That's a pretty big switch.From a farm in lowa to a sinkingship in the North Atlantic?- Well, I didn't plan on the ship sinking.I needed to get away,see some other places.There just wasn't anythingfor me on that farm.- I'll say one thing forya, you stick to your word.- What do you mean?- About seeing other places.- I bet you've seen a lot of places,working on a ship and all.- Yeah.I've seen a lot of places.I've met a lot of people.And sometimes a farm in lowadoesn't seem like a bad idea.- Sounds like the sea can be lonely.- It's not lonely now.- Hey, Trieste?Who's gonna keep the fire going tonight?- As a matter of fact,Mr. Morgan, we all are.We're gonna take turns standing watch.- Standing watch? For what?You expecting company out here?- You never know, Mr. Morgan.You never know.- Is anything wrong?- No.- John, you want me toset up watch tonight?- Good idea, Case.I'll take the first one.And be sure to tell everyoneto keep their eyes open tonight.- Okay.- Mr. Quinn.Mr. Quinn!- Watch it!Watch it!- Case, here!Diane!Are you all right?Are you all right, Mrs. Gordon?- Yes, I'm all right.Just a few cuts and bruises,nothing much to worry about.- How about you, Cathy?Cathy!- No, she's all right.She's more shaken up than anything.- Those eyes.I could see those eyes!They were everywhere!- John, you bettercome take a look at this!- My leg!My leg!My leg, ooh!- We need something rightaway to stop the bleeding.- Wait.- My leg!- Give me that.Just hold him up. Hold him up.- Be careful!Be careful!- Morgan, just be thankfulwe're fixing it at all, will ya?- All right, all right!- Pull him up, don't touch it.- All right.- It's gonna hurt.- You'll be okay, it'll be okay.- Oh!- You'll be all right, Morgan.Just relax.- It hurts!My leg!- Well, what the hell were those things?- I don't know.- Did you see how theycame from every direction?Must be millions of them out here.- And they're gonna be back.I know they're gonna be back.And when they do, webetter be ready for ‘em.- Well, we can't stay here.- No, you're right.This place is much too open.Our best bet is to eitherhead for a higher groundor get back down to the boat.- Boat?If we go in the water, how can we survive?- Phil, we don't stand a chanceif we stay on this island.- Everybody's gonna havea say in that decision.- Even Morgan?- Even Morgan.We figure we have two things we can do.Either head for higher groundand find a better placeto fight these things off,or get back to the beachto be near the boat.- Well, what do you think we should do?- We'll wait until it gets lighter,find a better place tofight these things off,get some food together,and get off this island.- I'll go along with that.- Yes.Anything to get away from those things.- Finally, we're getting somewhere.- Anyone else have any other suggestions?All right, rest up.We'll leave in a little while.- Hey, Morgan, we're gonnahave to keep this clean.- Cathy.Look what I found for you.- Oh, Mrs. Gordon!- All right, let's see, here we go.Now let's fold this down a little bit.- There's not much you cando for this, I'm afraid.- Well, maybe we could holdit together a bit here.- Oh, that's wonderful.- There. How's that?- Morgan.Will you be able to keepup to us with that leg?- Are you trying to get rid of me?Is that what you're trying to do? Huh?I'll keep up with you if I have to crawl.You're not gonna leaveme on this island alone.You're not! You're not!- Morgan-- You're not!- Morgan.As much as I don't likeyou, we won't leave you.How are you ladies this morning?- Well, we didn't exactlyget much sleep last night,but we're okay.- How far do you think we'll have to go?- It shouldn't be that far,but it all depends on how fastMorgan will be able to move with that leg.- His leg is pretty bad, isn't it?- I'm afraid so.If he doesn't get some kindof medical attention soon...- Listen, you have enoughto worry about with him.We should be fine.- Yeah, we'll be fine.- I wish he had your spirit.All right, let's move out.Can't waste anymore time.And everybody, stick close together.- It's in the tree!- Come here, come here.Stay close together, come on.- Oh!Oh no! My leg!He got me! My leg!- There he goes!- Quinn!Forget it, Quinn!Quinn, forget it!- He went through those bushes!- I got him!I got him, did you see that?I got him!- Take it easy.- I got him.- Come on, let's go.- I got him! Look, look!- Yes, okay.We see him, Morgan!- Let's go, let's go, let's go!- I'm sorry, Mrs. Gordon,I didn't mean to scare you like this,but we've gotta stay together.- I'll stay close after this, believe me.- Oh my God.- Hey, John.- Mr. Trieste.- One minute.- Mr. Trieste.- One minute, Miss Gordon.Stay right there, I'll be right back.- But...- John, we better take a break.Morgan's having a rough time with his leg.- All right, we'll take a break.We're gonna take a break.How's it going?- I don't get it, John.We're supposed to be in theNorth Atlantic someplace.If you ask anybody whodidn't know any better,I'd swear we're in the tropics.- I know, this whole damnplace doesn't make any sense.- I don't get it.- Maybe its just a bad dream.Where's Mrs. Gordon?Mrs. Gordon!Mrs. Gordon!Don't!- Oh, it's delicious!Try some!- You could've been killed!- No, look!There are fish in there!Oh, oh!Doesn't this feel wonderful?Oh...- Ooh!- Oh, Mrs. Gordon.The shawl.- No, I want you to have it, dear.- Thank you.- Cathy, it looks lovely with your dress.- Mr. Morgan, this willkeep you a bit cooler, okay?John, what's our next move?- Get some food.But first we're gonna have to buildsome kind of shelter against those things.- Well, how many of thosethings do you think there were?- I just hope there's not many morethan what we've seen so far.- If what we saw lastnight was all of them,we stand a pretty good chanceof fighting them off withsome kind of shelter.- We have another problem.If Morgan's leg gets any worse,I might have to amputate it.- Amputate?No, we don't have theequipment to amputate out here.- You won't have to worry about that.No one's touching my leg.- I don't think I could eatany more of those berries.- Oh, I know.That water felt so great.Didn't it, Cathy?- Oh, I could stay there forever.- How do you feel, Cathy?- Much better.- Good.We're gonna have to be leaving shortly.- I'm done!- What's that?- Mrs. Gordon!- My leg!- My leg!- How's Mrs...- No!
