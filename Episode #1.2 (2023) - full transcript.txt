We had severalcorrespondence with him.They then rallied to make a planand set up around theFour Points Sheraton.-Ultimately, getting thatconfirmation from Williamsonchanged everything.-It wasn´t until that interviewthat we learned thatRamirez was an informantand working with police.-Jorge´s family hadbeen in the dark,searching for answersthey couldn´t getfrom the BakersfieldPolice Department,answers they feltthe police had.Look at Mama.Say, "Hi!" Say,"Merry Christmas!"-I had never heardof another casewhere a informantwas injured or killedthe way it happened to him.-How did this unfold?If Ramirez was workingwith law enforcementto lead them to their suspect,a known violent offender,how did Ramirez end up dead?-My son, prior to his death,he started to kind of getsentimental and started crying.I said, "What´s wrong, son?"He goes, "Hey, Dad, you know,I got to tell you something."He says, "I donesome stupid stuff."I said, "What are youtalking about, son?"He goes, "Yes, Dad.If something happens to me,you got to remember this, Dad...It wasn´t my choice."♫♫-Bakersfield has long been knownas a town thatsupports its police.Detective Damacio Diazarrived as an outsiderfrom nearby McFarland, asmaller, more rural, town.-I was the first one in ourneighborhood, in our family,in our church, thatbecame a police officer.When I put on the uniform,there was a lot of pride.-Diaz was determined tomake his mark on the force.But it wasn´t always byfollowing the typical path.-I wanted to be the kindof cop that was in the mix.I didn´t want to be the kindof cop that was writing ticketsor going to a report call.Most police officerswill catch the bad guywith just doing police work.But there are some criminalsthat are not going to be caughtor they´re not goingto be prosecutedbecause there´s justnot enough evidence.I didn´t notice when Iwas crossing the line.So, by the time I wentto a narcotics unit...it was very clear whatI was willing to do.Things like go undercoverand buy drugs and sell drugs.For me, my life changedwhen I began to tolive that lifestylein these dark areas,these dark corners.♫♫-Young police officers canbe pretty impressionable.What is importantis how do agenciesput checks and balances in placeto ensure that people arenot going down a bad path?-I believed, withall my heart, that,so long as the end result wasa bad guy going to prisonfor a long, long time,it didn´t matterhow he got there.I had always beenthe kind of guywho was never afraidto take those steps.-As Damacio Diaz and hispartner, Patrick Mara,rose up the ranksof the BakersfieldPolice Department,they quietly kept theirmethods under wraps.-I can tell you that thereare many, many police officersthat I was friendswith, that knew me,that didn´t know how farI had crossed the linebecause we didn´tdiscuss those things.They were not part ofthat small, small groupand Patrick Mara and I were.Me and Pat Marawere great friends.We were very close.Working with informants wasone of our primary duties.There are some strict guidelinesthat are expected to be followedand we are trained on how togo about signing somebodyup to be an informant.But there are rules and policiesand then there´s doingthings that most cops,most police officers in America,have no idea takes place.-For years, Diaz andMara worked undercoverand under the radar.And then, suddenly,Damacio Diaz foundhimself in the spotlight.♫♫When the "McFarland,USA" movie came outand it was an instant success,of course, everybody inKern County and Bakersfieldloved the movie becauseit put us on the map.-Diaz.Diaz.Diaz.-I could never imagine thatanyone would be interestedin our story in McFarland.- Coach.- It´s not going to matter,unless...- Coach.-It´s a story abouta hard-working familythat comes from nothing,that have great values.-Hey, Damacio.-Look, you wouldn´t understand.-It´s about Damacio Diazand his family of farmworkersand how he and his brothersbecame champion runners.-He really became likean overnight celebrity.The local officerbecame this movie star.He attended the premiereof "McFarland, USA."I can distinctly remember theshot of him on the red carpet,smiling ear-to-ear.-You know, this is justway beyond our dreams,but we are enjoying it.We´re enjoying the show.During that time,I had a lot ofarrogance about me.Did it change me?Yes, it did.Was it for the better?I would say no.I allowed myselfto get caught upin all of thatHollywood limelight.-And, soon, Diaz and theBakersfield Police Departmentfound the spotlighta difficult place to be.-How do you do, friends?Welcome to...-I think Bakersfieldis most well-knownfor the Bakersfield sound,which is essentially like asubgenre of country music.-One of the most popular songs,of course, with Buck Owens, is"Streets ofBakersfield."-♫ How many of youthat sit and judge me ♫♫ Ever walked thestreets of Bakersfield? ♫♫♫-Bakersfield is likeso many other townsacross the American West...Migrants and outsiders vyingto stake their claimand make a home.♫♫-Bakersfield was a destinationfor migrants duringthe Great Depressionthat were coming outfrom places like Oklahomain the 1930s, especially.-Never had to loseeverything I had in life.-The Joads, in "TheGrapes of Wrath,"were portrayed asstruggling and poorand they´d lost theirland and they were pulledinto California in searchof new opportunities.-The diversity that wesee in Bakersfield todayis really just an outcropof the historical diversitythat we´ve always had here.Some of my ancestors camestraight out of Oklahomato do some of the differentthings in agriculture.We had Basque familiesthat raised sheep.We had Italian families thatmigrated here years ago.But there are alsosome pieces thatare more sordidand more shamefuland we don´t alwaystalk about those,but they have been here.♫♫So, one of the thingsthat you always get,with any kind of diversity...Often, there aresocial tensions.-How do I want to say this?There are definitelyareas of townthat are known historicallyfor being areas wheremostly one race lived there.Oildale?Pretty much all-white.-Oildale was a sundown town.A sundown town is a town where,if you are brown or Black,you shouldn´t letthe sun set on you,meaning you will get killedin one of these townsthat calls themselves white.-Historically, whitescontrolled law enforcementthroughout Kern County.In the 1920s, certain leadersof the Bakersfieldpolice were revealedto be Klan members.And, to some membersof the community,that legacy informs theirrelationship with policeto this day.Law enforcement has had acontroversial history herein Kern County.It had that good old boycommunity feel to it.-From 2009 to 2019,68 people in Bakersfieldwere shot by police.81% were people of color.Black people were four timesmore likely than a white personto be shot by a BPD officer.Latin people weretwice as likely.-One thing about Kern County isthat many Latino residents saythat they weren´t understoodby law enforcement...and that was, perhaps,something that fueledthese confrontations, whichsometimes turned deadly.-Calahan. Bakersfieldpolice still investigatingthat high-speed chasealong Highway 178that ended up ina deadly shooting.-We were just like, "Oh,my gosh, another thing?This is exactly whatwe´re talking about."-At the time,there were stories oflaw enforcement officersdoing whateverthey wanted to do.There were storiesthat I didn´t know of,where law enforcementwere killing people.-For the Ramirezand Silva families,every headline about anotherkilling rips open old scarsand adds new membersto their grievingand growing group.♫♫James De La Rosa had just lefta night out with his girlfriendwhen he encounteredBakersfield police.He was 22 years oldand had never had anytrouble with the law.-On November 13, 2014,officers attemptedto stop a Jeepwith James De La Rosa inside.They said he wasdriving erratically.-They follow himand, at some point,on Highway 178, try toinitiate a traffic stopand that´s whenhe starts to flee.-There was a briefchase that ensuedand he ended up pulling upto Mount Vernon and 178.-It was onto the freeway,missed one exit, gotoff on the second exit,hit the center divider,which was a huge impact.Did he hit his headon the dashboard?Did he hit his head onthe steering column?Was he dazed?-It´s impossible to know James´state of mind after the crash.But the policereleased their versionof what happened that night.-Immediately upon himexiting his vehicle,he began behaving aggressively,charging towards the officers.He was yelling obscenities.-There´s something that happensinside of theminds of an officerwhen you turn on thosered and blue lightsand you´ve got a carthat´s not stopping.-You have to remember that thoseofficers had adrenaline pumping.They were excited.They didn´t knowwhat was going on.-He reached suddenlyfor his waistbandand grabbed onto his waistband,at which pointofficers opened fire.-Mr. De La Rosa was unarmedand there are witnesseswho says that he washolding his hands up.-We don´t havewitness statementssaying that he had raised hishands in a... to surrender.-In fact, witnessestold a different story,with some capturingcellphone video on-scene.-We just seen a guywreck and then he got outand just he got out of the carand just waved hishands up in the airand the cop shothim in the head.Yeah, oy.-They fucking killed him.-Oh, my God!He got shot!-Reaching for a waistbandhas basically been usedto justify many shootingsof unarmed people around Americaand James De La Rosawas one of them.-The more the police repeatedtheir version of the story,the more his family questionedwhy they would kill someonewho never had a record.Or a gun.-James is not a weapon person.There was no weapons onhim, no weapons found.-Why would a personjust charge the police?So, why would a person rapidly,quickly advance on policeand reach for their waistband?You know, are they suicidal?Are they crazy?-James´ family points toone possible explanation.He had recentlylost a lot of weightand his pants were often looseand would start to fall down.-If he reached forhis waistband...If that did happen,that if that occurred...It would only be for Jameslifting up his pants.They stuck with thestory of James got offand approached the officersand they murdered him.-To the police, this wasanother justifiable shooting.But not to thefamilies of those lost.Don´t shoot!Don´t shoot!Don´t shoot!-Yet, everyone agreedthat what came nextwas completely unjustifiable.-So this is kind of where thestory takes a very bizarre turn.-Because of it being anofficer-involved shooting,they assigned an officer tostay on guard of the deceased,which was Aaron Stringerand his trainee.-What happens, accordingto two documents...Which was really the chillingside of the end of the story...Was one of the officers,Aaron Stringer, allegedly,according to his trainee,manipulates the corpse.-He moved towardsthe decedent´s feetwhich had been uncoveredwhen the sheet was movedoff of the upper torso.While "joking around"Senior OfficerSTRINGER reached outand touched the bottomof the decedent´s feetand said, "Tickle, tickle."-Police officers have oftenbeen accused, rightly,of having a morbidsense of humor.You are a firsthand witnessto man´s inhumanity to man.However, there are certainactions and behaviorsthat are indicativeof a deeper problem.-Senior Officer STRINGERturned the decedents head backto a straight forwardposition, two times...It was at about this timethat Senior OfficerSTRINGER said he...and laughed.-For them to play withtheir deceased bodies,you know, so disrespectfuland uncalled for.-He touched them in waysthat he shouldn´t have.My son was a joke to him.That was no joke.-This is somebody weheld dear to our heart,thatwe miss very dearly.-Aaron Stringer was placedon administrative leave.-Officer Stringer may have beenfired or may have just resigned,but no criminal chargeswere filed against him.It certainly was a blackeye to Bakersfield police.-Aaron Stringer left thedepartment in August of 2015.Stringer did not respondto our request for comment.-I think, when you hear astory about an unarmed manwho´s been shot deadby police officershaving their corpsetampered withand made fun of,that is a very dark,very disturbingthing to know about.♫♫-When I sat down andspoke to Chief Williamsonabout some of thesereally quite shockingofficer-involved shooting casesthat had happened in hiscity, under his watch,I asked him about onecase in particular...James De La Rosa.-Sometimesthings just ha...Things happen to officersand they´re put in situationsand they have to make thesplit-second decisionsand that´s what whythey´re out there.-I mean, just going backto one of those cases,Mr. De La Rosa was unarmed.-I don´t know who he is.Which one is he?-James De La Rosa.He didn´t know who he was.And, to me, at that point,it was pretty clearthere was somethingpretty extraordinary going onin this part of the country.-By 2015, as thenumber of people killedin officer-involvedshootings actually increased,so did the frustrationof grieving familieswith law enforcement.-An officer involved in theshooting with my brotherwas also involved in theshooting of James De La Rosa.-Name is Rick Wimbish.R-i-c-k.Excuse me.Last name is W-i-m-b-i-s-h.-The detail that we wouldstart to sort of pick outof these cases wasthe repetitivenessthat these officerswere involved in the shootings.-An officer shot aman allegedly breakinginto a Subway sandwich shop.-One officer firedseveral shots.Alderman later died...-Along with theincrease in killings,a pattern appeared to emerge.-Alderman was shot seven times.-After the initialpolice versionwas released to the public,new details often raisedserious questions.In many cases,it seemed there wasmore to the story.♫♫♫♫-It was about 4:20,4:30 in the morning.The police knocked at my doorandthe police said,"Jason Alderman reached forhis pocket and he´s dead."And they told me to have agood day and walked away.Didn´t tell me how ithappened, where it happened.Just told me they shotand killed my son.♫♫♫♫-On August 22, 2015,two Bakersfield policeofficers passed by a Subwaynear Olive and Roberts Lanethat they believed aburglary was happening at.So, they pulled in and they saidthat´s when they saw aman walking out armedwith what theybelieved was a firearm.-They confront Aldermen,who´s coming out ofthe establishment.That´s where an officer-involvedshooting happened.-Jason Alderman was shotand killed by policeat a Subwayrestaurant in Oildale.-That man, 29-year-oldJason Alderman,was pronounced deadat the hospital.-The news was hot totrot that, you know,Jason had some bumps in the roadand had some criminal history.-Alderman has a lengthycriminal record,including arrest for burglary.-I mean, I don´t eventhink it was six hoursand it was all over the news.That´s all that playedon the news for days.-A court search showspast cases against himfor drugs, alcohol,battery on an officer,and vehicle burglary.-People were just, youknow, thanking the officersbecause another criminal´sout of Kern County.-I know my sonmade a bad choice,but the police are...They´re not supposed to bejudge, jury, and executioner.-Jason Alderman was caughtin the middle of a burglary.But why was hekilled by the police?-I was told by thedetectives and the BPDI needed to contact you inorder to get a coroner´s report.So, there´s nobodyassigned to this case.So...No. My nephew got murdered.The person accusedof killing himis the BakersfieldPolice Department.Alright. Thank you.-There was obviouslyinitial callsfor whether or not therewas surveillance videoin that store whenthe shooting happened.Initially, police reportedthere was no surveillance videoand they did not haveit, if there was.-To our knowledge,there is no video,has never been video,and we certainly don´thave any video in evidence.-The news report was sayingthat the surveillance cameraswere down from 11:00 at nightto like 6:00 in the morning,which, again, I found oddbecause, if you´re a business,I mean, I wouldthink, at nighttime,you´d definitelywant to make sureyour cameras were rolling.-We went to that Subway andtook pictures of the areaand there was camerasoutside of the Subway.And then when welater went back,they had dismantled thecameras out of the roof.-What was the realstory of what happened?-Whatever evidence isthere should be, you know,obtained andcatalogued, documented.So, it´s vitally important thatvideo evidence, especially,is handled appropriately.-So, a woman from Subwayreached out to me.-She had posted onFacebook, "The video was on.I turned it on before I left."-We did get legalrepresentation immediately.His legwork was definitelyto find out what happened.In fact, therewas police footageand surveillancevideo and it did workand the police confiscatedit and took it.Nothing made sense.So, I was trying to get as muchinformation as I possibly could.I asked, I beggedfor that video.I wanted to see it.-One pattern thatbecame clear to uswas that informationwas slow to be releasedand transparencywas hard to come by.It was sometime rightbefore Christmasand I got a phone callfrom the police departmentand they told me that Icould come to the lobbyand pick up the video, so I did.♫♫-Mr. Alderman exited the Subway.He´s essentially shot deadpretty much straightaway.-I was completely flabbergasted.There´s no way hesaw those officers.He crouches under the door,literally almost on his knees,and then you just see gunshots.There´s no aid rendered.Two officers pick Jason upand put him throughthe hole in the glassand lay him on the concretein front of the store.Like if he was a piece of trash.♫♫-I´ve never seen the video.I´ve seen theclips from the newsthat they made myson look, you know,like he deserved it.I´m notable to watch that video.-I remember gettingthat surveillance videoand it revealed that the weaponthat police were talking aboutwas, in fact, a tire iron.-He did not have a gun.He was holding ablack BMW tire jack,that police ultimatelysaid resembled a rifle,and that´s why theybelieved he was armed.-I saw he had some typeof an object in his hand.I was at a distancethat I just couldn´ttell at that point.-Part of the equation is howfast can you pull the triggerbefore they have a chanceto pull the trigger?-At that time, you believedhe was holding a gun?-Absolutely, yes.-I think a lot of officerswould´ve seen thatas a weapon, to be honest.But you can buy yourselftime, if you´re behind cover.You can buy yourself time,if you´re making agood tactical approach.The problem is, isthat, when you´reat a point of no returnand you don´t havetime and distancethat allows youto make decisions,you are going to have to dealwith the very firstdanger that comes to mind.♫♫-He was in the process ofeither pointing it out the dooror coming out the door with itabout the time Iheard the shots.-I´m going to call that bullshitbecause that is what it is.If you were to watchthe entire video,that tire jack isnever pointed up.It is always on the side of him.He is carrying it,but not like a riflewould be carried,and it was neverpointed to anyone.-It follows this pattern thatcommunity members talk about,which is shooting firstand asking questions later.-And you don´t reallystart looking at itfrom a different perspective,until it does affect you.You know, I´ve alwaysheard about it.I did follow theRamirezes´ case,the De La Rosas´ case.I followed that, too.But I thought, "Man,that just must´ve beena couple bad officers."And, as you startunraveling the layersand looking at thepieces of the puzzle,you start to seethat there´s morethan just a couple bad officers.-When you ask about whatdiscipline officers have faced,you don´t get an answer.A shooting is ruled justifiedand an officer isreturned to work,but if anybody faces discipline,it´s very hard to know whatsort of discipline that isbecause it´s allshrouded in secrecy.There is a singleofficer who was involvedin all three of those cases.I think, for somepeople, it´s bad luck,but for other people,it may displaya chronic lack of training anda real culture of impunity.-Jason Alderman died.What is this chiefgoing to do now?He declared it was justifiedand Rick Wimbishwent back to work.-Rick Wimbishdeclined to commenton his role in these shootings.But controversy overpolicing in Kern Countywas just heating up.A blockbuster story of policecorruption was about to eruptand shed new light on thedeath of Jorge Ramirez.-Police Chief GregWilliamson addressed concernsabout police corruption...- Bakersfield Police Departmentdetective pleads guilty...- Admitted his guiltin federal court today,in an ongoing scandal.♫♫♫♫-So, I show up to thepolice department.I´d never seen so manylaw enforcement officersfrom different agencies ina room like that before.So many different mediaorganizations were there.Walking into that room, itwas a very serious tone.The public informationofficer walked aroundand handed us each a packetthat sort of detailed theindictment and what happenedand everything kindof blew up from there.-This morning,Bakersfield PoliceDetective Damacio Diaz,43, of McFarland, wasarrested in this building.He was charged in a16-count indictmentthat was returned yesterdayby a federal grand jury.It charges Detective Diazwith one count of conspiracyto distribute and possesswith intent to distributemethamphetamine,three counts of bribery,with nine counts ofattempted possessionwith intent to distributemethamphetamine,with one count ofillegally disclosingthe contents of a wiretap,and two counts of filingfalse federal tax returns.♫♫-Damacio Diaz hadcollected drugswhile working for theBakersfield Police Departmentand, instead of submittingthem into evidence,he put just aportion into evidenceand then sold the rest forhis own beneficial gain.-You can´t make this stuff up.One side, a celebratedcharacter in a Disney movie;and then the fall fromgrace as a disgraced officerwho´s basicallytrafficking narcoticsonto the streets of Bakersfield.-He was also workingwith this informant,telling him informationabout what lawenforcement was doing,to help keep him frombeing prosecuted.-Along with localhero Damacio Diaz,his partner, Patrick Mara,was also arrestedin the scandal.-Another formerdetective, Patrick Mara,admitted his guilt infederal court today,working with Diaz inan ongoing scandal.-We couldn´t believe it.I just said, "You know,how can them guys dothat kind of stuff, youknow, who was watching them?"I just couldn´t understand it.-I did what I did and Iwas wrong for doing itand I admit that today.But I will tell you,in full disclosure,that I didn´t knowhow to get out.I had discussed itwith my partner,Pat Mara, numerous times.We both knew we had to walk awayand stop this behavior,but we were stuck.I was stuck. I didn´tknow how to get outand I was very scaredabout what was goingto happen to me in the future.But within a few minutes,after being arrested,there was such arelief in my spirit,in my heart, that it was over.I was relieved.I lost focus on who I wasand what my purpose was.I began to not onlybend the rules,I began to cross the line.In very tiny, incremental steps,but those small steps added upand, sooner or later, Iwas way beyond the line.Meeting withinformants by myself,paying the informantoff the books,whether it was in moneyor whether it was indrugs or in favors,was a practicethat was standard.That was normal, for me.♫♫-If you fail torespond to the cues,if you fail to acknowledgethat there are problemswithin your midst,you´re going to have corruption.-As the scandal engulfed theBakersfield Police Department,questions surrounding policeconduct over the yearsintensified.If this kind ofcorruption had taken holdamong BPD officers and theinformants they managed,then what really happenedwith Jorge Ramirez?-We realized that Patrick Marahad actually been involved inthe Jorge Ramirez Jr. case.-You can draw the conclusion,from what ultimatelyhappened to these officersand their fall from grace,that they didn´t always dotheir job in the right way,that there was kind of a flyby the seat of your pantstype of informant managementprocess that was going on,and that very wellcould have contributedto some of the componentswhere Mr. Ramirez was killed.Everybody kind ofput a spotlight backon that Jorge Ramirez case.-We were all watching thenews and we were like,"Oh, my God!"And when they said onthe news, you know,they were puttinginformants in danger,like that could be whathappened to my brother.♫♫-Bakersfield PoliceChief Greg Williamsonaddressed concerns aboutpolice corruption today.-I remember wewere all just mad.This is exactly whatwe´re talking about.This department is corrupted.-After the corruptionscandal was revealed,there were increasingconcerns about how informantswere handled by BPDofficers, like Diaz and Mara.But despite the scandal,the department remainedtight-lipped on the details.-Ramirez´s family is now askingwhether Ramirez wasa police informantwho was leadingofficers to Hargerthrough a deal that wasbrokered with the department.-On August 14, 2013,a Bakersfield policeofficer named Lerry Esparzasearched Jorge´s home,a legal search that was acondition of Jorge´s parole.-My brother just kept breakinghis probation or parole.I think it was really hard to gothrough that shortperiod of timeof the life he was living,that he wanted out.He didn´t want togo back to jail.He was about to have a babythat he wanted to be there for.Jorge was arrestedby Officer Esparzaand taken into custody.Mr. Ramirez inquiredthat there´s got to besomething he can do for meto help make hiscase go away for him.He did not wantto go back to jailand asked if there´sanything that he could doto help make this case go away.My response was that,if that was somethinghe was willing to do,we exchanged phone numbersand I said to give me a calland we would moveforward from there.-I was not part of theJorge Ramirez case.I was never there.I never met him.I won´t speak on anybodyelse, but for me, personally,I handled informants formany years, all the time.Sometimes they were arrestedand, instead ofbeing prosecuted,they became an informantand they had an obligationto work off their case.-In my heart, now, I believethat my son was tryingto just get this outof the way, you know."Just leave me alone!Let me live my life!"-I showed him theconfidential informant packet.He didn´t want to sign it.He didn´t want to puthis fingerprint on it,for fear that that informationmight be somehowgiven to the public.-If you put out their name,saying Joe Blowwas an informant,helping law enforcement,the criminal activity aroundhim and those that commit itcan be very viciousand vindictive.-You have a processestablished in your agencythat requires registration ofyour confidential informants.Why? Because there has to besome level of documentation.-Officer Lerry Esparzasaw enough potential inJorge as an informantthat he arranges a covert lunchwith one of BP´sthen-rising stars...Detective Patrick Mara.-I was aware that mypartner, Patrick Mara,had met with andknew Jorge Ramirez.Pat himself told methat he knew him.Patrick Mara wasa very tough guy.He was fearless.He had brass cojones.-Detective Mara said those wereall handled with informantsand he was just tryingto get his point acrossthat informants areutilized all the time.The information is not leaked.He was just trying to gainsome trust with Ramirez.At the end of that meeting,Ramirez acknowledgedthat he felt comfortablewith Detective Mara.-Mara was intrigued enoughto delay one of Jorge´scourt appearances,to give him a chance to provehow valuable hisinformation could be.-Ramirez had anupcoming court dateand, perhaps, that wasthe point of leverageto be able to get theinformation that they wanted.-Patrick Mara says nothingcame out of his plansto use Jorge as anarcotics informant.But in the daysafter their meeting,Jorge thought he couldprovide police informationon the whereaboutsof Justin Harger,a dangerous criminal highon their most wanted list.-So, Chief, how was JorgeRamirez then killed?If he, as we understand,was not armed,was he shot accidentally?-Well, I think the problematicissue in this case isthat Jorge Ramirez placedhimself in this position.We were responding to theflash and sound of gunfireand returning fireat the same time,so, it´s quite possiblethat Mr. Ramirez wasshot at that time.-While not a registeredconfidential informantthat night, Jorgebehaved as if he wasand probably neverthought he´d lose his lifeto the very same police hewas providing information to.-Informants are humanbeings, just like you and me,and we need to protect them.-This goes back to the lackof checks and balances.-Because of thedecisions that they made,they failed miserably.-Justice is what we want to...I´m waiting to seethe real story.I´m waiting forthem to expose to uswhat really happened that night.-There´s just so manyturns and twists to itthat you go like,"Where´s the truth now?Where does it go from here?"♫♫♫♫♫♫-The discovery of textmessages and phone callsgave the Ramirez family a windowinto what actually occurredthe night Jorge died.Calls and texts between Jorgeand Officer Esparza beganaround lunchtime.Sometimes Esparzareaches Ramirez...-3pm - Esparza texts Ramirez.3:03pm - Ramirez texts Esparza.- and sometimes Ramirezcan´t reach Esparza.-At one point oranother, we figured outthat my son wastalking to an officer.-I honestly didn´t evenknow my brother was talkingwith Lerry Esparzauntil the text messages.-The Bakersfield PoliceDepartment had been lookingfor Justin Harger in relationto a shooting investigationthat they were working on.-Justin Harger... wantedas an armed shooting suspect.-Ramirez was wasacting as an informantand helping police that night.In broken conversationand missed callsand cut-off texts,but was trying tolead police to Harger.And then, just before 10:30,Jorge Ramirez sends the textthat would set thistragedy in motion,two simple words,letting the police knowthe whereaboutsof Justin Harger.♫♫♫♫♫♫♫♫♫♫♫♫
