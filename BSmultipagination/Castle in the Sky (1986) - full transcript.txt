Pirates! A gas grenade! Hold them off! Get down on the floor. Tear gas! What are you waiting for? Break it down! Where'd she go? Here she is! Mama, she's getting away! Well, get her! Mama, I'm falling! There's the amulet. Quick, go next door! Get that crystal! Damn! The crystal... Castle in the Sky Executive Producer Yasuyoshi Tokuma Music by Joe Hisaishi Production Studio Ghibli Producer Isao Takahata Original story written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki 2 meatballs, please. Working a lot of overtime? We're finally busy again. Still working? Yeah. What's that? A person! Pazu! What are you up to? Where's my dinner? Boss! A girl fell from the sky. Boss, she fell from the sky. Darn worn out clunker. Boss! A girl... Turn off valve No. 2. Pazu, toss me a wrench. I can't let go. You take it. Don't keep them waiting. Keep a steady hand. Brake! Any luck? No silver, no tin even. Digging here is pointless. Shouldn't we have dug to the east? That place is riddled with old pits. We'll have to start over. That's enough for today. Put down the boiler. No overtime tonight. Times are hard. We'll end up starving. Pazu, lubricate the clunker. Mama, we couldn't find her. It's too dark. Hope you searched thoroughly. All right. We'll wait for daylight. Hi. How are you feeling? Hey, come on guys. I'm Pazu. I live here by myself. When playing, I feed them. So you are human. I feared you were an angel or something. Thanks for helping me. I'm Sheeta. Sheeta, nice name. You fell from the sky. A bit scary. That's right. Why am I still alive? I fell out of an airship. Don't you remember? Say, can I see that? This? It's been in my family for generations. It's beautiful. Wait! Watch this! So it wasn't the amulet then. Pazu, hold on. Are you Okay? Yeah and you? I'm fine. Sorry, did it hurt? Yes, my head is hurting from my boss's fists. The pot's boiling. Hungry? Let's eat. Wash up over there. There's a towel. Thanks. Laputa... Sheeta! Where are you? My father took that picture. That's Laputa, an island in the sky. An island in the sky? They say it's only a myth. But my father saw it. He took it from an airship. There's a Laputa in Gulliver's Travels, but Swift made it up. Dad drew this. He said the abandoned palace was full of treasure. But nobody believed him. Until he died, they called him a liar. But my father never lied. I'm building a real plane. I'm going to find Laputa! A real automobile. How rare! They're pirates! They attacked the airship. Are they after you? Yes. Quick! Morning! Hey, wait! We're in a rush. Have you seen a girl? A girl? Yes, yesterday. The boss's kid, Madge. Off you go! Bye! They're after you. Louis, a girl's dress! What! She was disguised! Tell Mama! ...haven't seen her. A cute little girl. Black hair, braids... Boss! About that age. That's her! Pirates! They're chasing her. Pirates! Let me see! Not one step closer. Hand her over. Pirates? Dola's clan. Leave us alone. We are just a poor lot. Ma'am? Bail out the back. I want to fight. They've got weapons! But...! What a lovely girl. Better protect her. You refuse to step aside? Use your fists. Could be interesting. Get him, brother. Show your stuff. Wow. Who's going to sew that shirt? You can beat him! That's it, hit him! Think you can fool me? After them! Climb on! There you go. Playing hooky for a date? Bad guys are after us. The Dola clan. Pirates? Take us to the next town. To the police. You're on. Stoke the fire. Mama! You idiots! Hurry up and get on! What? But the girl's... She slipped out the back door. Get moving! Brother! Wait! They're catching up, more steam! Can't you go any faster? She's an old-timer. Move over! Mama, I can't hang on! More steam, they're gaining on us! Here we go! Sheeta, over here. Stoke the fire. Don't give up! Push! Push, I tell you! Not so fast! Don't let them escape! Dump these off the rail. That'll teach them! I'll do it. No, let me. Wait! It's them. What'll we do? I refuse to give up. Move! This is a surprise. If it isn't the army. These kids need help! They've got pirates after them. Sheeta? Goodbye. Wait! Sheeta! Halt or I'll shoot. An armored train. Who cares! Ram it! What is it, Sheeta! Stay away! They're falling! Quiet. Watch closely. We're floating! Look! It's the amulet. It was the crystal then! Amazing! We'll float all the way down. Marvellous! I want it. Fire! I have to get that crystal amulet! It's fading... Hey, wait! It's just like when you landed. The opening looks so narrow. I hope the boss and the engineer aren't in trouble. Don't worry. Miners are no wimps. Come on, let's find the way out. The mountain is long been riddled with mine beams. Here. I'm so happy. I was starving. I've still got an apple and some candy. It's like you have a magical bag that contains everything. Gondoa? That's so far north. Yes. When my parents died, they left me the house and farm. So I was getting by alone. The guys with dark glasses kidnapped you? That guy was one of them? Who can they be, calling in the army? Dola and the other guys, they all want the amulet. But I had no idea it had mysterious powers. It was always in our family. Mother left it to me when she died. She warned me never to show or give it to anyone. We're both orphans, aren't we? I'm sorry I dragged you into all of this. When you fell from the sky my heart was racing. I knew something wonderful was at hand. Little imps... little imps. Uncle Pomme! He's a nice man. Uncle Pomme. We've lost our way. Now that little imp surely looks like Pazu... With a little girl imp beside him. Pirates are after us. And the army. How extraordinary! Drink up. Thank you. Have you always been living underground? Why? No. The rocks have been stirring... That's when I like to be down here. The rocks were stirring...? Rocks speak very softly. Wonderful... Pazu, look up! They were just rocks until... How bright... Here, let me show you. It's gone. These rocks contain Volucite. Volucite? Once it's exposed to the air, it becomes ordinary stone. It's glowing... My gracious! That's a Volucite crystal, my dear. I've never seen one before. That's why the rocks were stirring. This crystal has mysterious powers. I thought only Laputans knew how to make Volucite crystals. Laputans...? They used Volucite to send a magnificent island aloft. Laputa did exist, Sheeta! It really did! Does the island still exist? Uncle Pomme? Dear, would you mind covering the amulet? Its light is dazzling me. What's wrong? My grandfather told me the rocks stir when Laputa floats overhead. If you went up to the sky then, you'd find Laputa! Sheeta, my father was telling the truth! Young lady... Your amulet...Yeah. Your amulet is most powerful. I know it as one who has spoken to rocks all my life. A crystal so powerful brings happiness, but it also often brings misery. What's more, your amulet is the work of men. How on earth did you...? The crystal isn't dangerous! It already saved Sheeta twice! Brilliant! Laputa really does exist! It's gone. Mama, let's go back to the ship. When it's this quiet, it's best to stay put. I'm hungry... It's all clear. Let's go. Thank you, Uncle. Take care of yourselves. Look at those clouds! Beyond those clouds is an island we've dreamed of. Here I come! I know I'm gonna find Laputa! Pazu... I haven't told you everything. My family had a mysterious, ancient name... that came with this crystal amulet. My name is Lucita, Lucita Toelle Ur... Laputa. Laputa? So you mean... It's the army! Run! To the cave! Don't move! How dare you! Pazu! Get off me. Pazu! Pazu! We've apprehended them. Good work. Open up, open up! Sheeta... Company, march! Use force! Coerce the brat, she'll talk. Speak like a man in uniform. In your haste, you risk everything. If we'd mobilized sooner, we'd have bagged Dola as well. She managed to decipher your easy code. What? My department will handle this. Concentrate on mobilizing the troops when the time is ripe. Muska! Remember, I command the search for Laputa! Of course. But I have my orders from the government. You pencil-pushing upstart! Had a nice rest? Where's Pazu? Let me see him! Not interested in pretty dresses? Don't fret about Pazu. His hot head is harder than mine. Come, I have something to show you. Enter. What is it? A mechanical soldier with enormous destructive power. Until before he fell from the sky, nobody believed Laputa was real. He's not of this earth. Our science can't even discover what material he's made from. Look! Don't be afraid. He's long dead. Look at that. This insignia was carved on your fireplace. It's on this amulet too. The crystal works only in your hands. It protects its owner and will guide her back to Laputa. I know nothing of this! Take it if you like. Just leave us alone. Perhaps you imagine Laputa is some Treasure Island. Formidable scientific power thrusts Laputa into orbit. Their fearsome empire once ruled the earth! Even you can appreciate that when such an entity roams the skies, it threatens peace. I need your cooperation. You must know how to make the crystal guide us to Laputa. I really don't know! Please let me see Pazu! I intend no harm, but his fate rests with you. The boy goes free if you assist us. Lucita Toelle Ur Laputa. But how...? Ur means ruler. Toelle means True. You are Queen Lucita, rightful heir to the Laputan throne. Out! Sheeta! Pazu, are you hurt? I'm fine. But you? Did they do anything to you? My dear Pazu, we misjudged you. Accept our apologies. We didn't know how gallantly you protected her from the pirates. Sheeta, what did you... Pazu, I beg you to forget about Laputa. What! Sheeta will aid us in our search for Laputa. I understand how you feel, but forget about her. Is this true, Sheeta? But we... Thank you for everything. I'll never forget you, Pazu. I don't believe it... Sheeta, we promised! Farewell! Sheeta! Wait, Sheeta! Be reasonable. Act like a man. Sheeta! Here's a token of our gratitude. It's yours. Only you can recall the words that will waken this crystal. If you keep your promise, you shall be free too. Pazu... Mama, it's Pazu! He's back! Pazu. We were worried sick. You just disappeared. And the girl? Forget it. Pazu! Get off me! What are you doing! Put a lid on it! Nice place you got, kid. Get out! This is my house! Oh, come off it. Can't even protect a little girl... He's got gold! Sold her for money? No! I wouldn't do that! You let them pay you off? Sheeta told me to do it. So... So you gave in and crawled home. You call yourself a man? You talk big, but you are after Sheeta too. Of course, we're pirates. Pirates hunt for treasure. Those guys are weird. What's the girl to them? You think she'll get out alive? So, Sheeta told you to leave? They threatened her, so she tried to save you. How do you know, Mama? I've been a woman for 50 years. She steels her heart to save her man. How touching! Reminds me of my youth. You boys want to marry. Look for one like her. So that girl will grow up to be like Mama? What a waste. I've got all your codes. Calling the battle cruiser...? They'll pick her up and take off? We'd better hurry! Dinner's over. Move out. Yes, Mama. Going after Sheeta? We want the crystal, not the girl. The amulet is no good without her. May I go with you? I have to help Sheeta! Do it on your own like a man. You're right. If I was clever and strong, I could've defended her. Please, I don't care about treasure. Listen to him. Shut up! He could help us with her. You'll be an outcast forever. I know. You sure? Yup! Be ready in 40 seconds. Take care, you guys. Tie this to your belt. You boys wait on the ship. A magnificent vessel. Has the girl talked? I need a little more time. Forget it! We'll squeeze it out of her up there. We depart at dawn with the girl. Step on it, it's almost dawn! Sheeta! What shall we do? Sheeta, listen, I'm going to teach you a magic spell for trouble. A magic spell? Yes. These are old, old, secret words. They mean ''help me rekindle the light''. Perfect. Just as the ancient books described. This is the sacred light. Sacred light? What are the magic words? Tell me. It's moving! The robot, it's alive! Hello! Help! It's alive! It's the robot! The robot? It's coming this way. Run! Retreat! Retreat! Incredible! I see! It's the light! The sacred light resurrected him! The way to Laputa is open! Come. No! It can fly! It's pointing to the sky. It's showing the way to Laputa. Hurry! Explosives? Idiot! You'll blow up the fortress. Hello, hello! What is this? Good. We're connected. This is Colonel Muska. The robot cut communication with the ship. I've assumed emergency command. It's after the girl on the tower. Take it down on sight. Prepare to fire. Quick! Hurry up! Fire! Forward! We did it. Get the girl. Is she dead? Get up! She just fainted. Stand up. It moved... What's that? Looks like a war. Let's go, Dola! Call me Captain! Charles, a little lower. Stop! Stop it! Please. Mama, Goliath's pushing off! We're going directly into the crossfire. Regroup! Look, there's Sheeta! What? Where? Straight ahead, she's on top of that tower! This is a woman job! Cover me. Sheeta! Sheeta, I'm coming. Pazu! Fly closer! Pazu! Let me go! Sheeta! Dola! Pazu! Pazu! Pull up! Last chance! Grab her on the fly! Pazu! Here goes! Move aside! Damn! Sheeta! What's Goliath doing? A smoke screen? Muska, where's the robot? Destroyed. The girl went that way. What? Put out the fire! Organize a search party! We haven't lost the sacred light. Its light points to Laputa. Inform the General, we depart for Laputa as planned. He's lucky. I can't believe she'll grow up to be just like Mama. There's your valley... Right back where we started. Dola, take us aboard. Call me Captain! What use are you without the crystal? We'll work. I want to see Laputa for myself. Don't want any treasure, just to see Laputa? Suspect motives for boarding a pirate ship. Mama, are they coming with us? One false move and you're shark bait! Excellent! No more laundry or cleaning! Or dish washing! Or potato peeling! Can you make pudding? I like mincemeat pie. I eat anything! Enough out of you! When will those boys ever grow up? Get off! Canvas. It's made of cloth. And don't tear it. Hurry up, it's stuffy in here. Hurry, this way! I hate dawdlers. You're with me! Pazu! I don't bite. Come. You're not here for fun. What an engine! Now where'd he go? Pops! Pops! Look, we got you an assistant. Don't holler. I hear you. He's tougher than Mama. Be careful. My hand doesn't fit. This gasket? Name? Pazu. The crystal pointed nearly due east. You sure about that? I could see the sunrise from the tower. It's the harvest season now, so the sun rises just south of due east. The light pointed to the left of where the sun rose. Good answer. Any luck? Not a peep. Jammig radio signals, are they? Mama, Goliath's faster. What do we do? We're upwind of them. If we get a lift on the trade winds... My east-style calculator. Windspeed is 10... and... I think we can catch them. OK, listen up! Goliath's on its way to Laputa. We're on their tail. With these winds, I expect contact tomorrow. 10 gold pieces to whoever spots her first! 10! Whatever we find, I'm sure Laputa has riches enough for any pirate gang! Earn your keep, boys! Now! Course 98, speed 40. That get-up of yours won't work. Wear these. Your station. Beautiful... You serve 5 meals a day. Go easy on water. Get to work, you morons! Yes? I'm sorry, dinner isn't ready yet. I've never cooked on an airship. Do you need something? Beautiful... I thought I'd give you a hand in my spare time. Why not? Can you put those dishes away? Happy to oblige. You said your stomach hurt... I've got some free time. Can I... You're in the way. Some stomach ache, jerk! Hey, can I help... So, you were scared too? They have Goliath. It sounds hopeless. It's Laputan treasure I'm seeking. They're certainly nice kids... Get to the point, you old goat. Nothing. But you show me respect. What's that? That's checkmate, isn't it? Excellent... delicious... Seconds anyone? Seconds! Seconds! Hey, shake a leg. It's your watch. Take it, it's cold. Watch? Darn cold! Go on up. My turn. Great! Sheeta! That was horrifying! The sky is beautiful. Sheeta. Get in. Can't you sleep? It is warm. You, look behind. Pazu? I'm scared beyond words. I don't want to go to Laputa actually. I hope we never find Goliath. You mean...? No, the light showed the right way. But... You mean the robot? Poor thing. I never dreamed that little spell would work. I learned lots of other spells. To help find things, cure the sick. And one I must never, ever use. Never, ever use? A spell of destruction. I had to learn bad ones as well but never used them. I was so terrified that I couldn't sleep. That amulet should be locked away. They hid it in the fireplace. It was worn only for weddings. My mother and grandmother and great grandmother feared it. I wish it had never existed. You're wrong. We met thanks to the crystal. Even without the amulet, Laputa won't disappear. Airships are improving. Someone will find it. And what if Laputa is really a land of terror? It mustn't fall into the hands of Muska and others. Besides... If we run awy now, they'll chase us forever. But don't become a pirate for me. I won't become a pirate. Even Dola understands. She's nicer than she looks. Once this is all over, I'll take you back to Gondoa. I want to see where you were born, the valley, the yaks... Pazu... What's that? Below us, look! Goliath, right below us! Come about! Full rudder! We should tail them. They'll be trouble if we don't! We can't catch them in these clouds. We'll get them. They won't go far. Steady as she goes. We're farther north than I thought. Pazu, listen up! Time's running out. If we lose Goliath, it's all over. Keep your eyes peeled. Track them from the crow's nest. What do I do? That lookout post is a glider. See the crank? Yeah. Turn it clockwise. Once it's locked, the upper lever unfolds the wings. Use the wire to stabilize them. Figure out how to steer as you go! Sheeta, you there? Yes. Get back down here. Why? Because you're a girl! But so are you! Besides, I'm a mountain girl with sharp eyes. Sheeta! Please. Pazu agrees. Once you're aloft, the voice tube won't work. See the head set? You mean this, right? Wow... OK. I give it a try. Release us. Here goes. They're gone. Slipped into the clouds. Look sharply! They could be everywhere. Aye! Hold on tight. What's wrong? We're fine. Just ran into a gust of wind. We're keeping watch. Scared? No. I'm getting the hang of it. Rough skies ahead. Sheeta, get the rope ou of my bag. Tie yourself to me. The mercury's dropping, Mama... Lousy luck. Storm coming up... How long till dawn? One more hour. It's dawn. Strange that the sun's rising on that side. I see. We must be heading north, not east. Bridge! What! We're heading north? The compass is pointing east. The shifting winds must have put us off course. Look! What is it? Goliath? It's a cloud. A huge one. A cloud? It's rolling to us! A castle in the sky. We're headed into a low pressure system. Turn her away, full speed! It's sucking us in. Hold tight, we can't help! The helm doesn't move! Where's your brute force? Engine's burning up! Stop whining and find a way out! We're clearing the clouds! Sheeta, the ocean! The Dragon's Nest! So this is the Dragon's Nest. Just as Dad said. The wind is blowing the other way. Look out, a wall of wind! Mama! It's sucking us in! Don't give up! Hold on. Bridge! It's Laputa! What was that? Dad saw Laputa inside the Dragon's Nest. Don't be ridiculous! It'll tear you to pieces! Pazu! Look. Just what we need. Let's go! Dad did it. He made it back. All right, into the Dragon's Nest! Got them! Our ship's in danger. We must withdraw. Stay on course. The light's pointing right into the cloud. Laputa's in there. Stay on course. We'll find a way in. Here we go, Sheeta! Sheeta, Sheeta! Are you all right? Look... Laputa...? Wait... I tied it really tight. My hands are shaking... We did it! Birds... Where is everyone? Coming to greet you? But I haven't the crystal. I cut the rope. What are you doing? Wait. Please don't break it. We need it to get home. A flycatcher's nest! That's why he's here? See? All your eggs are fine. The birds aren't afraid. It says to follow. You understand it? Just intuition. It's a city... What an astonishing place! Sheeta, can you see the sky? If their science was so advanced, what happened? It's a grave. I wish I could read the inscription. Someone left flowers. Do you put these here? Pazu! It's a different robot. It must've broken down long ago. Probably a gardener robot. It protected this place even after the people went away. You picked flowers for the grave. Thank you. Are you all alone? Are there any other robots here? He doesn't seem lonely. He's got friends and birds' nests to look after. This way! This section is destroyed. They got the Tiger Moth. I hope the pirates are fine. Sheeta, look there! They're prisoners! They hang pirates. We must help them. Let's go! We found a way in. Look, mountains of treasure. Wow... Want some? I'll give you plenty of rope. Have you reported we found Laputa? Just about to. Make the code strong and complicated. Hey! No looting! Perfect distraction for those morons. What intricate roots! You can climb trees, can't you? I see a way. No better than thieves. If they reach the garden...! Sheeta, let's find the amulet. It's the only way to stop them. I was wondering why the clouds parted. So that they could land. Was it my spell...? Muska was right. The seal's broken. The kingdom's waking up. It's welcomed the visitor with the amulet. But Muska will become king. He's got much worse in mind. But what do I do when I get the crystal back? Wait, that spell! You mean the destruction spell? Down and around. I'll go first. It's here somewhere. Please God... This is it! It's that kid. No! Don't shoot! Capture her. Well, so she is the little princess. Sheeta! Damn! What is it, Colonel? The last of the pirates. There's one right under you. Yes sir! Get him. Sheeta, wait for me! Pazu! Grenades! Is that Pazu? What? It is not what think. The General is over there. Troops, fall in. Hurry! Dola! They captured Sheeta. I'm going after her. I'll cut you free. Get out of here. Hey, wait! Take this. Thanks. The boy has become a man. What? Muska destroyed all the radio equipment? Yes, while the ship was lightly guarded. Several troops are badly wounded. The Colonel entered the inner palace with the girl. The soldiers saw him. That upstart's finally showing his colors. Hunt him down and arrest him! All units! Hey! Hurry! Shoot if he resists! Find the entrance. Where are we, Colonel? Laputa's core. The castle above is just a trifle. All of Laputa's knowledge is crystallized here. You two wait here. Colonel! Only royalty can enter the sacred area. What is this! The roots have invaded... Eventually, we'll burn them all. Come, this way. Confound it... Yes... This is it! Here too! Damn it! Found it! Behold the giant crystal! Source of Laputa's power. Fantastic. It has awaited the king's return for 700 years. 700 years? Your family forgot even this? The black rock! As the epics described. I can read it. I know what it says! Just who are you? I also have an ancient, secret name, Lucita. My name is Romuska Palo Ur Laputa. We are descended from the same royal family. Later it split into two branches. Not even a crack. It's indestructible. Deploy all our explosives. Force will be of no use, Your Excellency. Muska, where are you? What are you waiting for, General? All right, all after me! Forward! What is this? Muska, where are you? Silence! What on earth? Watch your tongue. You're in the presence of Laputa's king. Are you insane? Let's celebrate Laputa's return with a demonstration of its power. Sheeta! Behold Laputa's thunder! Sheeta. It's the heavenly fire that destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. It's the Ramayana's Arrow of Indra. The world shall bow down before Laputa once more! Wonderful, Muska. You're a hero. A monumental achievement. I'm sick of your stupid face. Run, everyone! Die! It's those monsters! Look at them...Run! Are the Flaptors OK? Mama, ready to fly. Let's hurry! Quiet. Keep your voice down. What are those two doing? I have to leave them behind. I advise you not to irritate me. We'll be alone here for a long time. They should've escaped. You think you can fight me? Robots! Sheeta! Fantastic! A marvelous display, ain't it? Die, you insects! How dare you! Be a good girl, give it back. Please, open! Just where will you go? Open! Sheeta! Pazu! Pazu! Sheeta, I'm coming. Get back! Take this, hurry! Muska's coming, quick! Toss it into the sea. Sheeta. Hold onto the amulet. I'll trade her life for it. Get up! No more hide and seek. How delightful it should end in the throne room. Come here! The throne room? This will be our grave. What is a king when his country lies ruined? I won't give you the crystal. You'll die trapped here with me. There's no escape. This is why Laputa died out. There's a song in my valley. Put down your roots in the soil Live together with the wind Pass the winter with the seeds Sing in the spring with the birds Your weapons may be powerful. Your pitiful robots may be plentiful. But you can't survive apart from the earth. Laputa will not die. It will rise again. Its power is the stuff of human dreams. Next, I shoot off your ears! Beg for your life. Tell the kid to hand over the amulet. Wait! The crystal is hidden. You can shoot, but you won't get it. Stay away, Pazu. He'll kill us both. I'll spare her life if you tell me where the amulet is. Or do you intend to conquer me with that cannon of yours? Let me talk to Sheeta alone. Run away. Take the crystal and run! 3 minutes. Sheeta, calm down and listen. Teach me that spell. I'll say it with you. Put your hand in mine. I cut the pirates' ropes. Time's up. What do you say? My eyes! My eyes! I can't see... Mama, it's collapsing! All right, let's go. Hurry! Mama, the bottom's falling out! Sheeta was such a nice girl... They used the spell of destruction. Those kids rescued Laputa from those idiots. It's stopping! A crystal! A humongous one! It's rising. The tree... it's carrying it away. Chase it! You're heavy, get off. I can't. Sheeta! Pazu... The roots protected us. We can still use this. Here goes. What are you doing? We're not moving. Of course not, we're overloaded. It's Sheeta! She's alive! Dola! Thank God you're alive! You guys all right? No! My galleon's wrecked... Stop blubbering. We'll build a better ship! You poor child, the worst is having your hair hacked off. I can't breathe. Sorry. Pathetic. All that work and only this to show. We ran out of time!
