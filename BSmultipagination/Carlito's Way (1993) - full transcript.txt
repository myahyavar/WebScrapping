Listen to me carefully, Carlito. Rudy says Pachanga is complaining about being broke; that he doesn’t have a single dollar. He’s also saying that you’re a piece of shit, and that you don’t have the balls to take care of the problem, and he’s wasted a lot of time without making any money. Besides, I hear he’s spying on us for Benny Blanco. Let me deal with Pachanga. He’s my brother. He’s your brother. That son of a bitch would kill his mother for money. See you tomorrow.
