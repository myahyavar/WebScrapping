- Hey, Jim. - Good morning. - Thanks. - Thank you. That all you're traveling with, honey? I'm Sharon. You wear a medium? Okay, uh… Cell phone is prepaid. Somewhere on here, it tells you the number. I was trying to think what else to get you. It's always different with each person. Eye drops, hair spray, whatever… Last guy, he liked to use conditioner instead of shaving cream. You just let me know what you need. Do you need me to go slower? Let me help you. There you go. Good. Well, I'm sure you're more of an adventurer. I can't stand planes. Don't like being up in the air and all the people breathing down your neck. Good job, honey. All right. Now, let's stand up slowly. Bathrooms can be dangerous. Oh. Here, let me help you. Frank liked naproxen better than Advil. He had bursitis in his shoulder. He worked in the plant, packing TV dinners. I wouldn't eat 'em. All that ammonium, probably what got him sick. H-How long ago was that? Nine years. I got so good at taking care of him, I thought, why can't I do that for a living? So I went back to school and got licensed. What a miserable life. I'm so sorry. It's okay. People say things they don't mean. Sometimes they can't remember words. It'll get easier. Do you remember this man's name? John Jones. Mary Black? I have no idea. Okay. And now with the other hand? You got it. Good job. It's all right. Going back. Sharon! Sharon! You're okay. You're okay, honey. Aw, it's okay. It's okay. Just breathe. Listen to me. Aw. Shh, it's okay. You're okay. That's it. Just breathe. Just breathe. In… …and out. In and out. One more. One more. You're doing great. Good. This is a big one. They won't be like this later. Are you with me? Thank you. You wanna go for a drive before it gets dark? Let's take this right into town. Look at you. You're ready to go. Pull over. You need to pull over just to the side of the road. Right here. I'm sorry. It's okay. I know this is hard. This isn't hard. Driving a car shouldn't be a victory. I mean leaving. Transition can be hard. If you're not feeling ready, we can look into extending your stay. I can't pay for that. I should be getting back anyway. Back home. No, back to work. Redeploy. You've made a lot of progress, but you're not ready to go back to work. Not nearly. Then what the hell was the point in all of this? Don't forget what we talked about, okay? Organize yourself. Prep for memory gaps. Make lists. Keep your lists. Put like with like. Find two of something, put them together like we worked on. I'm not gonna forget. People do. They can get a little ahead of themselves. Well, what's your plan for getting home from the bus? We can write it down. My mom is gonna pick me up from the bus station. Anyone else gonna be around? Your brother? Um, I haven't really been home in a while, and it's not like I'm staying for long. - So… - It can help to be with people. I'm good on my own. Ativan, Depakote, Cymbalta, Vicodin. The rehab's not over. You're gonna have to work hard every day to do all the things you used to do. Yep. I'm gonna be fine. You think you're so funny, don't you? I think it's in here. Hold on. Okay. I'll be right there. Hold on. Lynsey? Lynsey, I thought you said you were coming on Friday. Mom? You okay? I'm fine. I asked Debbie to get off work early Friday. I was gonna get groceries, clean out the truck for you, get a cake, pick you up. It was gonna be a homecoming on Friday. It's okay. Hey, you wanna meet Ted? No. I... I need to sleep. We'll keep it down. I gotta go to work early, but you sleep in. Hey, Lyns. I was worried about you. You look like you. Can I help you? I was wondering if you're still hiring. - To clean pools? - Yeah. You home for the summer? You in college? - I just got back from Afghanistan. - Oh. Thank you for your service. My father was in the Navy. Korean. But why do you wanna clean pools? I like the water. I used to clean the pools over at Newman. I guess there's not a lot of swimming pools in Afghanistan. Not where I was. No. - Can you drive? - Yeah. Great. Start tomorrow? Sure. Hey! Get the fuck off the road! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck. Ooh, yeah. What's this, '85 Scottsdale? Old, old body style right here. Got you a nice truck. Yeah. Not anymore. How long it been doing this? Uh, just now. I... I don't know. It's not mine. When the last time you changed the oil in it? I don't know. All right. It's all right. Hey, Santiago. Uh, you can wait inside. We got air in there. Yeah. Yesterday, I said it was the exhaust valve, and I was right. So, uh... Well, probably just the carburetor. And if it is, I can just get that part on eBay. It ain't that hard to find. It may take a while to get here. You in a hurry? I don't know how long I'll be here. - How much is it gonna cost? - Maybe about, uh, 350, 400, plus labor. Maybe more if we get in there and find it needs some more work. I don't know if I wanna fix it. It's not... It's not even mine. It's... Oh, no, now that… …I mean, that's... that's a nice truck. So… Okay, how about you just, um, leave it here with us? And when I get the part, I'll call you for an estimate. Yeah? I don't know my number. I mean, it's just business. No. I... I really don't know my number. Um, how about you, uh... How about this? How about, uh, you call me, and your number will show up. Okay? Can I... Can I see your phone? So what I'ma do is I'ma call me, right? And that way, my number will show up, all right? Simple as that. It's Aucoin. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Hey, '85 Scottsdale, you okay? I'm fine. I mean, it's real hot out. You want a ride? Where you headed? Just down near Tchoup and Bordeaux. - Gonna get a sno-ball? - No. Shit, maybe. Hey, you wanna play some music? You can pick whatever CD you like. My grandma used to play this record. She... Ooh, man, she loved her some Ernie. He's making a joke out of the blues though. - You grew up here? - Yeah, born and raised. You? Same. - Where you go to high school? - Newman. - Ooh. - I had a scholarship. I went to De La Salle. Aucoin, right? You know, most people, they just call me James. I knew a Jess Aucoin that went to De La Salle. That would be my sister. I played against her in basketball. She was tough. The weirdest thing about this song is that he actually got buried with his mother-in-law. Down on Claiborne. That's ironic. Oh. Shoot. I guess that's why people don't buy CDs anymore. - Know what? - Uh… …I'm old-school, so… Yeah. You know this one, right? - "Here Come the Girls"? - That's it. That's it. Okay, Newman. All right. First you scrub, then you use your skimmer. Get all your flowers and leaves off the surface. Then you get your leaf rake. That's the heavy net. You get all your rocks, twigs, acorns. Stuff that'll clog your main drain and damage your pump. Hey, you... you okay? Can you handle all of that? Yeah. Uh, main drain… All right, good. So then you're gonna empty the drains. And the drains are serious. You don't know what's in those drains. You can tell a lot about a person 'cause of what's in their pool drains. You really gotta give it some more muscle. There you go. People treat their pools like shit. Out of chlorine. Grabbing some from the truck. You think you can handle this on your own? Yes, sir. Great. Then you can start with Octavia Street tomorrow. Just come over after then. Yes, baby. Okay. I'll see you later. - Oh, you're in here. - I didn't see the truck. It's at the shop. What's wrong with it? What's it gonna cost? Don't worry about it. I'll... I'll pay for it. That's not what I meant. Um, how you feeling? Good. Okay. I'm good. Come sit with me awhile? I could use a drink. You tired? Yeah. Right. Hello? Anybody home? I'm back here, James. Damn, this place is nice. - I ain't gonna get shot, am I? - Not today. - Owners are out of town. - Ah. - Thanks. - Mmm, you're welcome. - Do you wanna sit down? - Yeah. Do you swim? Not exactly, no. - I saw it in your walk. - Mm-hmm, I get around okay. Did you serve? No. I take it you did? Something like that. I just got back. How's it going? - Yeah. - Yeah. And look straight up. And now the left. Very good. So, Ativan, Cymbalta, Depakote, Vicodin and a brain injury. From which you appear to be recovering extremely well. With brain injuries, there are never any guarantees. I'm feeling pretty good. In fact, I'd like to know what would happen if I stopped taking the medication? You'd be a high risk of seizure, anxiety, withdrawal and depression. I feel fine. Is it possible you feel fine because of the Cymbalta? Could you explain to me what caused the brain injury? Doesn't it say in there? Uh, it says, "Cerebral hemorrhage acquired in Afghanistan from an explosion while traveling in a vehicle." That's what caused it. But I want to hear your account of what happened. I'm just asking to come off these meds. I've never been medicated before, and I don't intend to be for the rest of my life. Lynsey, if you're looking for a neurologist who will give and take prescriptions like candies, I'm not the guy. I work for the Army Corps of Engineers. I specialize in water systems. I'd been deployed to work on a dam. Dam is a 20-minute drive from base. Three-vehicle convoy. Ten minutes from base, the lead vehicle explodes. I see it from the front window. And then my vehicle explodes. At first I don't really know what happened, um, but the guy next to me, a sergeant, is on fire. Flames up his legs and on his chest, and he's beating them. I can't see. I can't breathe. Eventually, someone gets the rear door open, and some guys start getting out. I see the sunlight, so I try to move towards it. But there's gunshots everywhere, and the guys who are getting out are getting shot. They're just getting out, falling over. Um, so I can't get out. But I need to get out because the guy next to me is on fire. Then I black out, and I wake up in the hospital. And they told me that the detonation caused my brain to start bleeding. Does that help your diagnosis? It does. Thank you for your candor. Tell me, how are you sleeping? Not great. Hi. Hi. You got food. Do you know how many times I've refinanced this place? Three. I talked to Debbie. They need someone in the office upstairs. We could take breaks together. That might be nice. I have a job. I'm... I... I got a job. You did? Doing what? Cleaning pools. What are you doing? Pools. I'm cleaning them. You'd rather work in 109-degree heat than in an air-conditioned office in a department store? I told Debbie you'd meet with her. I told her all about you. How smart you are. How beautiful. I can't work in an office right now. Of course you can. It's a good job. Has insurance. I can't stare at a screen all day. Just try it. I know it's not your dream job, but you don't wanna clean pools forever either. It's just temporary until I can go back. What do you mean "back"? Are you kidding me? When were you gonna tell me that? Wait, will they even take you back? - I'm gonna try. - In the shape you're in? It's not your problem. It is my problem when I get a call in the middle of the night from some doctor in Germany telling me my kid got blown up. I'm fine. I'll... I'll be fine. Okay, Lynsey. You're here for a visit, so visit. How are you? I'm not feeling very well. I told you that in confidence. - Careful of that corner. Mm-hmm. - Thanks. All right. Now this way. - Yeah. - Yeah. Okay. Hey, how much you pay for this thing? Fifty bucks. It's brutal, but I have to pass a test to get back to work. You got to pass a test to clean pools? - No. My... My old job. - Oh. You ever use one? Went to PT a couple times. I ain't been to the gym in a while though. Me either. - Hey, what's going on with my truck? - What truck? Nah, things just get busy. I got this white lady. She keep calling me to help her move gym equipment all the time. You know what I'm saying? Weird. What about you? Hmm? How the pool business going? It's cutthroat. - Really? - No. Funny. - Just putting it right here, right? - Yeah. That's fine. All right. Okay. Don't get all Navy SEAL and overdo it, all right? It's hot. - I can handle the heat. - All right. - Thank you. - Anytime. Yeah. All right. Hey, you wanna get a burger or something? Absolutely. I was gonna say the s... same thing. I just didn't wanna suggest that. I didn't want to be weird or anything. So, your treat, right? - I wasn't thinking that… - All right. I mean, I did just move… …a rowing machine for you. Hey, you tell him I said hey? Yeah. You know I will. That's on me, James. What you talking about, sugar? It's always on you. Not always. - Thanks. - Yeah. She went to school with my mama. Oh. - So you really don't drink at all? - Huh? You really don't drink at all? I haven't tried. You ain't never tried a beer? No. Not since I've been back. I'm... I'm kind of on a lot of medication. Hmm. What kind of medication? Like, "don't-shoot-yourself-in-the-head" kind of medication. Okay. You mean like, uh, pain pills? Crazy pills? Happy pills? - So far, just pain and crazy. - Oh. - Hey, can I buy you a beer? - What? You are really beautiful. Can I buy you a beer? - I'm okay. Thank you. - Come on. Have a beer with me. You're in a bar drinking root beer. We're in New Orleans. I think she said no, bro. Hey, I'll buy you a beer too, bro. Deaf and blind. Uh, no, because, uh, I already got a beer. And, uh, you know, my girl said no. - I'm... I'm not picking up that vibe. - Are you his girl? I'm really sorry. I have a boyfriend. Wait, wait. So she's your girl, and she has a boyfriend? Yeah, that's exactly right. She my girl, and she got a boyfriend. That okay with you, bro? - Don't shoot me for trying. - Hey, you have a good night. Stupid. Look, I know you're not my girl. - Do you know what I mean? I mean, I... - It's fine. All right. Uh, I didn't know you had a boyfriend. Oh, I don't have a boyfriend. - Hmm. - Are you with anybody? Nah. Uh… I was engaged. Once. What happened? Lost my leg. Can I try a sip of your beer? - You sure? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Yeah. Last one. Um, I wanted to say… …that thing about me not having a boyfriend... - Hey. Look. Nah, I... I just, uh... - No. Well, let me just... Um, I don't have boyfriends. I have girlfriends. I mean, not right now, but when I do, that's what I have. - Okay. Uh, I wasn't, uh... - No, I know... I know what you were doing, and I really appreciate it. I'm just telling you that because now you know that about me. Okay. Well… Okay. It's cool. - Thank you? - You're welcome. It's all good. It's all good. You know, I've never actually tried weed. Are you serious? I mean, my brother did enough drugs for the both of us. Ah, yeah? Crack, meth, household detergent. Some alchemy he read online. Didn't work. Burned his lung. Damn. - What happened to your leg? - Sheesh. - I really didn't see that coming. - Well, what happened to it? I was in a car accident. I got in a car accident with... with Jess… …and her son, my nephew, Antoine. On the Causeway. I remember… …looking in my rearview mirror, and I could see Jess's face. I just remember looking in her eyes. It was like she was saying bye. Like, "See you later." And then, um, I kind of wake up. And I just feel this pressing into me, like this really hard, hard pressing. Really hard. And, uh, it turns out the car was bent out of shape. And I'm bent with it. And this leg… …this leg is so fucked up that I could look down and the sole of my shoe is looking right back at me. And then there's these people screaming outside the car. Not inside. Did Jess die? Nah. Nah, not Jess. I'm so sorry. Yep. Hey, you good? Hey, look, if it get dark, now, you just... you just ride it. Okay? - Yeah. - Yeah. How do I do that? - That's... All right. - Uh… …what's dark? Being back here. So you don't got love for this city? It's not the city. Then what is it? It's that house. So many nights sitting at that kitchen table, and my brother would be nodding off. And my mom would say, "Oh, poor thing. He's so tired." I miss him. He and I were both trapped in that house. But I'm the only one that made it out. Anyway. And then I just... I just never thought I would come back here. But then I got blown up. You got... What? You got blown up? - Oh, shit! - Oh. Thank you. Okay. Well… What's the rush? You in a rush? No. Me neither. - Thanks. - Mm-hmm. It's a nice house. Big. Yeah. It's too big for me. You think? I got nothing against big houses. Yeah. It was the family home. You grew up here? No, no, no. Me and Jess bought it… …after my mama died. Just… …living here together. Three years of me, her, Antoine. It was, uh… Good. You stayed? Jess moved out, and I... Yeah, I did. I stayed. My mom stayed in the house we all shared. She's the only one left. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't think it's healthy. Staying. For her? Or for me? Actually, me. Hmm. Uh, you know you don't... You don't have to live with your mother. Mm-mmm. Could move in here. What? Yeah, move in. You got your own room. You know how many rooms I got? I wouldn't even know you was here. I don't think that's... I'm not... not h-hitting on you or nothing. I'm just... I know. But you're drunk. That's true. It would just be nice to have someone around. Hmm. Have coffee together in the morning. You know, smoke in the evening. Cook together sometimes. It's what we used to do. Hey. It's... It's whatever. Hmm. Hmm. Thank you for the ride. Sure. Please don't judge me. I'm not judging you. Where you been? Out with a friend. Have you been drinking? A little, maybe. Lynsey. I thought you were the responsible one. I am the responsible one. Just don't turn into your aunt Leslie. Or anyone from my family. Or your father's side. Okay, Mom. You hungry? I just had a burger. "I just had a burger." You used to be the funniest little kid, then you became so serious. Ah, you're probably tired. You got work tomorrow? This is luxury. So, what are your doctors saying? My next appointment's on the 22nd. I'll drive you. Oh, you don't have to do that. No, I wanna. They treat you better if you have someone with you. They know somebody cares about you, so you must not be too awful. - You sure? - Yes! Is it that unbelievable? Sorry. Thank you. Aren't your tits sweating? Get your ass in this pool. It's good for you. It'll relax you. Ah, geez, don't get in all at once. Oh. Ah! What? Why did you go so far away? I don't know. I wanted to. But why? Why'd you wanna? A lot of reasons. Any you want to share? No. You just couldn't stand it here? You can tell me the truth. No, I couldn't. When I was your age, I couldn't stay in one place either. I get you. I really do. Time for a refill. Hello? Oh, hello, Ted. Well, that's my voice. That's what it sounds like. No. No. I'm busy. I'm having a night with my daughter. How was your night? Don't be cute. Well, you're an idiot 'cause I don't want to see you. Oh, really? Hold on a minute. Let me move to the bedroom. No, I'm not doing anything. Hey. Thank you. I'm so sorry. Don't be sorry. It's cool. Stupid to think I could depend on her. She let you down a lot? Yeah. Somehow it still surprises me. It's all good. Come on, we got time. Probably even got time to get you that sno-ball you ain't get the other day. You think? It's on me. Mmm, good. - Ah. Thank you. - Mm-hmm. You're welcome. - Is that vanilla? - Oh, yeah. What? Something wrong with vanilla? I just didn't even know they made vanilla. Well, you got a whole rainbow in your cup. Yeah, that's the point. Hey, it's all right. I'll get you another one. - No, I don't want... - I got enough... No, I don't want another sno-ball. I wanna not fucking drop shit. Sorry. So, you drop shit. What's that about? I still have a few glitches from the accident. So that's what the doctor for? Fixing that? No. I mean, I'm fixed. Okay. Say it. It's good. So, this doctor you going to, you just going for fun? No, I need him to clear me, so I can go back. You got blown up over there, and you wanna go back? I just have to get out of here. And all I need is this guy to sign a piece of paper. We'll get you another sno-ball. I see you eyeing mine and I ain't sharing it no more. Look, I got enough cash to cover you for two more. After that, you on your own. How y'all doing? Aight. That good. - Headache? - No. - Sleeping? - Great. Mood? Fine. Yeah. I'm good. I was actually thinking, it's time for me to go back. To the military? Redeploy. Yes. You honestly feel you have a clean bill of health? Yes. I have my post-deployment screening, my hearing test, my vision test, my scans from Nebraska. What's left? Possible risk of reinjury, compounding the TBI, and, above all, your mental health. Well, that's my risk to take, and I told you, I feel fine. Lynsey, smoking is linked to lung cancer. Extreme trauma is linked to PTSD and depression. In fact, the link is stronger. I'm not ready to sign a waiver. I'm the one that has to be ready. It's both of us. I really appreciate today. Sure. I'm not working tomorrow. Do you wanna come by in the afternoon? Tomorrow afternoon? You working? I make the schedule, so… Well, we could go to that pool on Octavia. The owners are still out of town. Well, I'm not much of a swimmer, so… We could just get high. Yeah, that could work. It's on me. Oh, okay. Okay. We're gonna get in this pool now. Nah. I'm still cool. Come on. We gotta go swimming. Owners are back next week. Feels so good. Mm-mmm. Come on. Yes. Whoa! I can't believe you actually got in. Yeah. Damn. How long was that? I used to practice holding my breath as a kid. What's the longest you've ever held it? Twenty-six years. Ah, I got you beat by four years. - Challenge me to a race? - You sure about that? You count it off. - Three, two, one. - Two, one. Oh, what the fuck? Oh, shit. - Michael Phelps! Whoo! - Oh. You didn't even try. Well, it ain't like I got a propeller on this thing. Hmm? I feel like I lied to you. When? When I told you about the accident. - Lied how? - Well, not lied. I left something out. I wasn't really clear, and it's the same thing. 'Cause you didn't say that you were driving? Yeah. You said you saw Jess in the rearview mirror, so I kind of figured. Antoine... He was sitting next to me. He was in the passenger seat. Kept saying he wanted to sit next to me in the front seat, so… And Jess said no, that he was too small and that he needed to be in the child seat. And I said yes. I said yes. I thought I was supposed to say yes to shit like that. Give him what he asks for. Hmm. Spoil him. - You see... Uh... - I do. - No, I... - No, you don't need to s-say anything. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. Why'd you do it then? I just felt so bad for you. No. James. James, come back. James. James. Don't go. You felt bad for me? - I'm sorry. I didn't... - I got enough people feeling bad for me. That's not how I meant it. Then what'd you mean? Ah, yeah, you don't know. What is this? What is what? What are we doing here? Huh? I pick you up, I drop you off, and I buy you sno-balls, huh? Tell you something, you want a driver, call a fucking taxi. What you want from me? So I don't want to fuck you, now you don't want to be friends? Oh, okay, I want to fuck you. I want to fuck you, but you just kissed me. You really need to figure your shit out. I don't even understand you. Actually, I don't know shit about you, but I tell you what I do know. Facts. Uh, you blew up in Afghanistan or Iraq or wherever the fuck it was. You... You played basketball with my sister. Yeah. - And, uh, you got a dead brother… - I don't have a dead brother. What'd you say? When did I say I have a dead brother? He was. You miss him. You had. Past tense. He always past tense. - He's in prison. - What? He's a junkie and a dealer. - You made me think he was dead. - No. Yeah, you did. 'Cause you only talk about him like he dead. Maybe that's how it feels. Why does it fucking matter to you? That is bullshit. Oh, you want people to think he gone so they don't know you left his ass for dead. You don't know shit about it or about me. Oh, okay. Did you just assume we were the same, broken people wallowing in it? - Fuck you! - Fuck you. You think I lied about my brother? What about you? You let your nephew ride in the front seat that night. What else did you leave out? Were you drinking? Were you drinking? I'd had two beers. What's your excuse though? How you treat your friends, your family... Everybody there, just to be escaped from. Just to be left behind. Like they let you down instead of the other way around. And the other. I would like to go back. It's a very hard judgment call. I understand why you would think that. Do I still have any trace of my injury? I'm sure. But am I going to be a risk to anybody, unable to carry out my duties? No. I want to go where I'm useful. Can you go back? Yes. Should you go back? It's a different question. You said the link between trauma and depression is stronger than the link between smoking and cancer. Much stronger. What if Afghanistan wasn't the only trauma? What then? Okay, Lynsey. I'll sign the waiver. It's James. Leave a message. You're all set. Bring it back if it gives you any problems. Thanks. Uh, is James in? Not today. No. All right. Well, how much do I owe you guys? Didn't James tell you? It's free. What? Yeah, he said you were in the Army or something. It's you. You're alive. Yeah I'm alive. It's been a long time. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner. Don't worry. Mom hasn't come to see me since sentencing. Really? Yeah. Is she okay? She's fine. I worry about her. She wrote me a letter. Seems like she's having a hard time. Mom can take care of herself. How are you? I'm good. You know. I'm comfortable. Are you healthy? Am I healthy? I've been trying to gain some weight. I've got some friends in here. There's not much to do. So I've been trying to go to the gym. Honestly… I'm better off in here. I'm safe here. Out there, I don't trust myself. Enough about me. How are you? I'm good. I got hurt. But… …I'm okay. I'm really sorry. I'm not sad for me. I'm just sorry too. I miss you. I miss you. What's going on? I know that truck ain't break down. Truck's fine. Thanks for that. You didn't have to do that. So, what you doing here? Um… You asked me if I wanted to move in, remember? No. I remember. Would you wanna make the offer again? It would be good to have someone around. Have coffee with in the morning. Smoke in the evening. Cook dinner sometimes. And what's that supposed to mean? They're all things you said. So… …you're not leaving? I don't think so. Not now, at least. And… I'm trying to make a friend.
