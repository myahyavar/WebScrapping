I will be back before dark. Be a good boy and stay warm in bed. Alright, Ryo? Mom. You're awake? You were agitated. So many books. What is this? Plato, that's a tough one. I don't get a word. Are you a Tech University Student? Right. I'll tell my friends I slept with a University student. Megumi: Did you skip again? Good evening. I'm supposed to meet someone. Please. Sorry, I'm late. I just arrived. Hey. Let me introduce you. This is Ryo, we were classmates in middle school. This is Nido Shizuka, she's great. The bathroom? -Over there. I'll be waiting. Dude, she's loaded. She came to our host club last week. Of all the boys, she picked me right away. Well, obviously. Today is our first date out of the club. But we haven't slept yet. You know why? No. Keep a rich lady on her toes, she'll pay more. Let's have a contest. I make a cocktail better than the bartender's. If he says so. Sounds interesting. How can I lose to such an uptight guy? Just loosen a bit like me, you'll have a girlfriend. But he wasn't always so austere. Women bore me. He almost had as much success as me. Please. Please. -Thank you. How is mine? Really good. Now, the next. So, do I win the contest? For a quick shot, yours is good. Ryo's cocktail should be savored. Come on. Can we move on? With pleasure. On my tab. Thank you. I'll be waiting outside when you close. Where's Shinyo? I'm done with him. I'm more interested in you. Let's go. Where to? To my place. Do you have class tomorrow? I'll manage. I don't learn anything there anyway. Earlier you said, "Women are boring". Does sex bore you too? Sex is just a natural chore we must fulfill. You really think so? Maybe you can fulfill it with me. Sure. I wasn't going straight home today anyway. It's all the same to me. Alright then. I'll take a shower. No. I am your mistress... I want to taste your sperm. I want to check how naturally clean you are... check your habits. So? Shall me start? You will do it with this girl. Sakura, please say hello. This man is Ryo. She is pleased to meet you. Sakura was born deaf. But she can read your lips. Please let's see how you perform. I'll be sitting there. It's OK? Let's start. Sorry, Sakura. I can't hold it anymore. Thank you. The shower is at the end of the corridor. How was it? My performance? Your performance. 5 dollars. Hardly worth more. Sakura, thank you. You can rest in the other room. What is it? You barely passed. You can thank Sakura. Passed what? The 'passion test'. Do you want to work in my club? Where ladies meet younger men. It's sometimes called a 'boys club'. The boys earn a minimum of $100 an hour. You have passed the test for that minimum wage. They are... male prostitutes. Generally speaking, yes. But women are more refined. Oftentimes, they simply take you to a play or a dinner. Do you plan to fulfill that boring sex forever? It seems Sakura fancies you. I'm not too keen about your performance. You don't open your heart to your partner. You're not heedful of her signs. If you did this you'd be marvelous. You're in your world. First, don't tell women they're boring. You'll find passion only as much as you can inspire it. What you deem boring... is in fact wonderful... if you engage in this world. You can't keep denying women and sex. If you accept to work in my club. Give me a response tomorrow. "Dear Ryo, sorry, I'm not a skilled writer." "It was wonderful last night..." "I really enjoyed it." "Don't call me if you didn't feel the same." "I'll work hard on Plato for the next time we meet." Student in political economy since 2015 born in 1997, Morinaka Ryo. You don't need a fancy style. A simple and modern look will do fine. But on occasions you'll need to be classy. You'll need something lovely. Women don't like pointed shoes on men. Your underwear should always be impeccable. They'll want to see you in them. Alright. Is that good enough? Women are not only attracted to a pretty face. Your charm also lies in your mystery. Really? I really didn't expect that. The way we parted yesterday, I didn't think you'd call. Excuse me. Welcome. Let me introduce you. This is Ryo, my new recruit. This is Azama. It's a pleasure. Azuma is specially assigned to our VIP guests. Women would pay anything for him. Please stop, I'm not doing anything special. Ryo, you'll have to take a blood test. This is a prerequisite to work here. Yes. I don't know Madam Shizuka's opinion, but... I can tell, you'll be very popular. I don't think I'm that... You will most definitely be. There. This week's class notes and textbook copies. You have to attend classes. Many people start to look for a job in their third year. What do you drink? Campari Soda. Are you offering? Of course. Hi. You're here Megumi. Stop it. Look, while this guy is skipping his classes... I'm seriously working. Host is a serious job? I'm always serious about sex. I have both skill and experience. You're a perv. Sex is a science in my opinion. Surely not. But an orgasm requires skill. What do women consider good sex? How is it? Is there an experience women would give anything for? What got into you? Are you serious? Please, I'd like to know. Well, as you might know... we want the man we love to be passionate. But without love? I can't tell. I wouldn't do it without love. For example, woman who go abroad for casual sex? How would I know. Just thinking about it I feel degraded. And if they catch a disease, it looks bad. Right, that's terrible. Hello. Ryo, your first assignment. Shibuya at 2 pm. Be at peace, I warmly recommend her. Please, call me when you're finished with her. But, I don't know... There's nothing to it, observe her well. Use all your senses and experience to feel her. Approach with care. If you see an opening... resolutely move forward. Are you Ryo from Club Passion? Yes. Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you. You are my first guest. Yes, Madame Shizuka told me. I'm Miss Hiromi, I'm looking forward. You're a student? Yes, in university. Do you have a lover? I guess I haven't found the right person. I see. But I guess you... are surrounded with many great people. That's right. To some extent. But I don't want to talk about it. OK. How do you feel about a woman older than you? What do you mean? Give me a straight answer. Well... already as a child, I loved adult woman. And so... why do women, as they age, see this difference almost as a sin? To me that's the pertinent question. That's right. It was a pleasure. My regards to Madame Shizuka. See you again. Thank you. Hello, Madame Shizuka, she's went. Ryo, you first assignment is a success. Are you free tomorrow? Yes. Miss Hiromi has booked you again. Same place, same time. Keep up the good job. I left you with a poor impression yesterday? I thought you didn't like me. But I said, "See you again". You see, before going to a date... thinking about the moment ahead... one has that tickle in the heart, right? I love that tickle. And if the man is great... sleeping on the first date would spoil that emotion. Can a man understand that emotion? Some women don't need that emotion. You mean because they care for the man? No. Irrelevant of tenderness or love... even with their mind set on a partner, they delay the pleasure. But... It's hard when you have to wait. That's right. It's hard when you have to wait. I want to make love to you now. Ryo, you're good at this. Don't, I haven't cleaned yet. I want to know you better before. You can shout if you want. Ryo. Come, quick. Come. That's what he said. At that age they're very active. Rub my clitoris. Ryo. Miss Hiromi. Miss Hiromi. Miss Hiromi. Miss Hiromi. Miss Hiromi. Miss Hiromi. Miss Hiromi. Miss Hiromi, I'm coming, I'm coming. I'm coming. Ryo, that was great. From home to my favorite dentist... there's a thirty minute drive. That’s really far. -Right. Why do you think I drive that distance? I don't know. There's a very simple reason. Because he's a good dentist? Not even. He is not? Now, I'm really perplexed. OK, I give you a hint. Every time I go there, I have this tickle in my heart. Ah, I see. What are you drawing? Madame Shizuka, I'm finished. Excellent. You're our first boy who receives a fellatio on the first date. Miss Hiromi called. She wants to see you only from now on. I see. This is for the two assignments. The house only deals in cash. 60% of four hours makes $240. What? I earn several times more than what I used to. But it's very tiring. In a good sense. Right. All the boys, when they start... they're faced with women's immense desire, their unpredictability. They see this abyss with a sense of panic. Ryo, how do you feel? I don't feel that panic. To be sure... I have this urge... to get to know women better. I see. I'm counting on you. So many women to please... the variety of their desires is infinite. In this instant, all these women pursuing their desire... each in her own way... each, singularly, defined by that quest. Are you Ryo from Club Passion? Are you Mrs. Etsuki? What is it? You are so pretty, so ordinary. You too are very cute and very ordinary. What were you reading in the street? Plato, do you know him? Yes, I do enjoy him. Really? You're a rare young man. I've been a reader since I was a child. What do you like about Plato? What I like is... Socrates discoursing while walking in nature. Please, do go ahead. The river flows and it's so green... the summer cicadas are almost too loud... but I'm digressing, Plato is not about that. My favorite part is Phaedrus. Because he talks about love. Yes. But more than love... I appreciate that all his discourses start in a casual setting. Those moments flow bathed in the cicadas song. Maybe I felt that way because I read it in a park. The cicadas were so loud... as if Socrates and I were sharing the same space-time. Excuse me for a moment. Sorry, I was talking all the time. After that bottle, let's go to my place. A drink? I'm fine. Then... now it's my turn to talk. Yes. Maybe it was in summer. We were playing dodge-ball at school, I was sweating. I drank water till my stomach swelled. As usual, I went to the playground with my friend. But on the way back... We were in a passionate conversation... and my stomach started to hurt... I couldn't tell him that I wanted to go to the toilet. So, you liked that boy? Yes. And then... something amazing happened. As I was tightly rubbing my thighs... the heat moved from my stomach to a lower place. When my friend said we should go back... with my last strength I contracted my stomach... I contracted my thighs too... and that's when it happened. There was like an explosion in the lower part of my stomach. I was standing, bent forward and... I started to be shaken by spasms... and then I peed myself. The pool was the size and shape of a manhole. My friend was gaping and staring. That was... the first orgasm of my life. As an adult, even as my experiences accumulated... nothing ever compared to that ecstasy. And then... I would let any man in the street have me... if he'd watch me pee in exchange. But gradually... I felt the need to understand myself... and I looked for an intelligent man with a literary education like me. But I never found such a man. Just now... I just took a discreet little pee. Ryo, if you don't want to watch a middle-aged woman pee, you can leave. In any case you'll be paid as due. Please let me see. I want to see you pee, Etsuki. Thank you. Ah, I can't hold it, I'll do it here. Sure, go ahead. It's great. It's like my whole stomach is flowing out. Your class material. Thank you. A drink? The usual. A Campari Soda. I'm offering today too. Ryo, you look different tonight. You enjoy this job so much? I'm glad I found you. Could we dine together? Well, sure. Nice. What's your usual place? Sorry, it's a greasy spoon. It's fine. Woman as they age don't dare come to Izakaya. When a boy starts with us... I inquire if he's been respectful... by giving a call to the guests. Ryo, you have an excellent reputation. Really? The ladies say they don't feel the age difference with you. You probably have something special. It's a bit sad, if you want to hear it? My mother died ten years ago. I was ten, she was thirty-seven then. I had a cold that day, I didn't go to school. My mom said... "I'll be back before dark." "Be a good boy and stay warm in bed." And then she left. She was wearing a formal dress. I have a recurring dream about that last scene. In my dream I realize I can't hold her back. When my dad came back... he said that Mom had been urgently hospitalized. A heart attack. Mom had fallen in a busy street in Yokohama. After my mom died... I would ask women about their age... and be filled with an undefinable joy... when they said they were 37. Since then, the wall broke between me and older women. There you are. It seems, Ryo... that you are trying hard to keep... the last words of your mother. "Be a good boy and stay warm in bed." She was probably very gentle and beautiful. Madame Shizuka... I am sorry. Could you hug me? That's how I became a call boy. Stern faces, beautiful faces, some can't hide their fear... women came with so many faces. Are you Ryo, from Club Passion? Yet... none of them showed their desire. He hasn't touched me since I gave birth to our child. A sex-less life. And if I ask him... he says it's indecent to do that to a mother. Each of them has a story... and for some of them it's just that, a story. On my way here, I was wondering... what I would say or do. But even with only that excuse of an emotion... I always found them delightful. And so... it took upon myself to uncover... the secret weakness where their desire lies. As a call boy... I was becoming free. I'm so scared of him, if he gets mad. And so... uncovering for each woman that desire in her heart... I was bringing it out to the light. That's how I conceived my task as a call boy. Madame Shizuka, I'm finished now. And so... I pressed on ever deeper into the jungle of women's passions. Excuse me. I'm Ryo from Club Passion. Mr. Morinaka, look at me... I cannot embrace my wife. My cancer treatment has made me so weak... and my diabetes is not getting any better. And here you are. I hope you don't mind... I'm going to be filming the action. Ok. Please, take a bath first. My husband... has only a year and a half left to live. Sorry to hear that. But... I need a favor. That man loves to see me treated brutally. I hate to suffer but... I would like you to pretend to handle me roughly. Please make it as realistic as possible. Please. Please wear these. To remain as anonymous as possible... that way watching the video will be less painful. Please start. Madam... Can I tear your dress and underwear? I'm gonna put you to shame... while your beloved husband watches. Can you feel it? How about the other side? Look at you, you're so hard already. No, no. And down there, how about it? Look at you. What got you so wet? Your lady is such a slut. Come here, little bitch. Here I come. I want to hear you. Dear? Show us some flesh, there. Don't, don't. Morinaka, keep going. Right. Dear, dear. I'm coming, I'm done soon. Lose the condom and cum on her butt. Kiko. You're awesome. Dear. Mr. Morinaka, I took an excellent video. I'll send a special bonus to Madame Shizuka. Thank you, sir. You believed that old man and his young wife? If that were true, I'd shed a tear. I went there too once. This couple is famous for their plays. But the wheelchair prop carries their theater to a new level. But when she cries... even though she's acting, it's kind of sad. Think of it... he's so much older than her... how many good years does their couple still have? There... The special bonus from the Izumikawa couple. In our club... receiving a special bonus for a guest, means you are promoted. Now Ryo, you are Azuma's equal. You are promoted to the VIP class. Nice. See, I predicted it. I knew you would succeed. Azuma. How did you know? It's obvious... you are an ordinary person. All the boys working with us are, like, out-of-sync... maybe because they're perverted. How so? Do you know why I was promoted to the VIP class? Why would a guy like me... have so much success? Because I'm scarred all over. When pain is inflicted on me... my confused senses trigger pleasure in my brain. Thus, I attract all the wealthy weirdos. Even if they cut me with a razor... as they cut me once, three, thirty times... the pleasure intensifies. I wish I could open my heart as you did at Izakaya's. But tonight, I'm opening up to you. Most people would be grossed out... but you are sincerely listening. Can I go closer? OK. You don't have to do anything. You can just let it happen. I studied the body of ordinary people. Men or women, in the same way. I'm often complimented for my art. Before going to the main part... there is a definite amount of licking for each person. Azuma, don't do that. You can let it go. You liked it? While doing this... you didn't get excited? I'm happy to pleasure you... but it just fulfills me mentally. Is there something I can do for you? Please, break my finger. What? Just when it's about to break there's a surge of pleasure. I broke this pinky twice already. Can you help me? But what should I do? Just bend it backward. You must bend it all the way down. You're serious. Do it for me. Yes, harder, it's great. More. Ryo, please. Do you need ice? No. It's gonna swell for a couple of hours, it'll be amazing. Ryo, thank you. Oolong tea, please. I don't have any class notes, I just wanted to see you. It's free, right? And you? I'm fine. Alright. I held you in high esteem... but I was wrong. Shinyo told me everything. An ex-colleague told me. He works for Madam Shizuka too. He said, "We have that amazing new boy". You're selling yourself to cougars. This is prostitution, you're depraved. You're right... I am a call boy. You're a host in a club yourself. And your studies, what a shame. Studies are boring, who are you to judge? Are you serious, prostitution doesn't solve it. Even in a job that has no glamor, I find fulfillment. That woman who employs you, is she so great? She takes advantage of you. She had you believe it's a pleasant way to earn money. She's probably a freak, anyway. Enough. I never slept with her. I never even considered it. Just like I wouldn't sleep with you. We're not the same kind. Surely, you have another path. You're an ordinary person living with the night wolves. Excuse me. Are you Ryo? Today is my birthday. Do you know how old I am? About sixty? I'm seventy today. I can read people just by holding their hand. You're a good person. Tell me your story. Anything you want. I want to hear your story. Well... Earlier, I had a fight with my friends. They heard about my job. They said I was depraved. But I want to do it a little longer. I want to fathom my own depth. I want to see it to the end. Until recently I used to think that all the women in world... were boring. But I changed, and I owe it all... to one woman. Maybe I'm only seeking... her approval. So nice. You had an orgasm? At my age... your simple words caused it. How precious... is a hand. And your hand is good. It's coming again. Another orgasm? Hi. Where's Sakura? She's out. Ryo, you're working so hard. In our club these days... you and Azuma are competing for the first place. Thank you, Madam. I'd like to reward you somehow. Tell me what you want? Anything? Would you go out with me? You said I could ask anything. I'm old enough to be your mother. For me now, dating younger men... Who cares about age? Of all people you should now. Ryo. Ryo. Ryo. Stop now. Why do you stop me? You taught me to love women and sex. Please, you can ask for anything else. But I can't have sex with you. I'm truly sorry. Hello, this is Club Passion. What time and place would suit you? OK. OK. Very well then. An assignment. The person asked for you. Once more. Could I take the 'passion test' again? Sorry to bother you, Sakura. Like the first day I arrived here... could I take the test again? You'd know how I have matured. I'd like you to see. For me, it's alright. "Please grant Ryo..." "his wish." OK. Ryo. When you're finished, you'll take the test. Excuse me. I was waiting, Ryo. What do you mean? I am your guest today. Is that how you address your guests? You don't need that to talk to me. See life bustling in the sunlight... there, our friends and family strive... but you chose the realm of the night. That's what you said, right? "Even in a job that has no glamor... I can find fulfillment", you said. So, would you find fulfillment with my body? I didn't expect you to be so expensive. I had to pay a month's salary to have you. Show me how good you are. What are you trying to prove? I did it with your friend, Shinyo. A call boy should be better than a host boy. Since sex is your trade. Come on, do your job. Do your job. My feet are dirty. Don't. You can come. I need a condom. Raw is fine, quick. This is a rule in my job. Don't let me repeat it. Ryo. Ryo. Ryo. Ryo. Ryo. Ryo. Ryo. Ryo. I loved you from the first day. But I get it now. We don't live in the same world. You are a shining in your world. Calm down. You can still come to the bar. As long as you wish... the drinks will always be free. I just... finished. Let's go. It seems that Sakura really likes you. Don't nurture any hopes about me. Please date her from now on. A long time ago... I was doing this job too. With one of my guests... I conceived Sakura. But that man immediately broke up... when he saw that she was deaf. I was desperate. When she was all grown up... she offered to help me with the club. Of course, I refused. She wouldn't take no for an answer. And so... she looked for what she could do. All this... because of my sickness. I am HIV positive. Even with all the precautions... there's always a risk of infection. I had to muster all my restraint... to stop you today. I wanted the passion test again... to show you how much I love you. Ryo. Let me see how you make love. Sakura. Madame Shizuka. Mom. Sakura? Dear Ryo... Club Passion was reported to the police. Even as you read this letter... I am probably being interrogated. All the data and records have been destroyed... so, be at peace. There is something you should know. I hesitated to tell you. But I think you'll definitely want to know. An acquaintance in a club in Yokohama... told me that your mother... was working there as a prostitute. She fell in a busy street on her way home. But now, Ryo... I think you will not blame your mother. I don't think you'll resent or despise her. You, Ryo and your mother... Sakura and I, we all have this bond. Maybe, you'll find this ridiculous, but... I believe we were destined to meet. I don't know how my sickness will evolve. But I hope that one day... we'll be able to live the three of us together. Nido Shizuka. Excuse me. I am Ryo from Club Passion. It's been a year. Today... could you listen to my story? Yes. Now... he's probably in heaven. My husband died ten years ago. On my birthday every year... he visits me here. Look there. Outside the window. He's looking at me. He and I... we made love here... for the first time. You want to have real sex? As I age... my secretions are getting sparse. This... will ease the penetration. Then let's do it. I missed you. Yes, we just reopened. Yes. Really? I'm looking forward. When then? Alright, it will be a pleasure. Madame Shizuka. Now... I finished.
